Things to Remember:

  

- make your bedroom like a cave---dark, quiet, cozy, and cool; bedroom essentials include an eye mask, ear plugs, a cool temperature, and maybe smart white noise

  

- studies show that each person's optimal sleeping hours vary, but its range starts at 7hrs and above; test your optimal sleep by increasing your sleeping time by 30min for each week (ie. +30min for 1st week, +30min for 2nd week)

  

- it is preferred to not eat 3 hours before sleep, but if circumstances arise and you need to eat, choose food that is not heavy and is not fried, fatty, sugary, tomato-based, or with caffeine or alcohol (ie. nuts, milk, whole grain cereal, raspberry, banana; not food like fried chicken with ketchup with alcohol/coffee)

  

- if you take night baths, it should be at least 2hrs before sleep
