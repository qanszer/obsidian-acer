PREFACE

====

  

- This book is great for people who are prone to despair

- It does not discretely answer the question of the title, but rather provides a map to the reader to reach his own answer

  

What helps us during great suffering?

====

Temporary Comfort:

- image of beloved persons

- religion

- grim sense of humor

- healing beauties of nature

  

Lasting Comfort

- will to meaning

  
  

Central Theme to Existentialism:

"to live is to suffer, 

to survive is to find meaning in the suffering."

  

- If there is a purpose in life at all, there must be a purpose in suffering and in dying

- He who has a 'why' to live can bear almost any 'how'

  

Dr. Viktor Frankl

"Don't aim at success---the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. 

  

For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued---it must ensue, and it only does so as an unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself, or as the byproduct of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. 

  

Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. 

  

I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run---in the long run, I say!---success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it."

  
  

CHAPTER II

====

  

Logotheraphy

- focuses on the future, or the meanings to be fulfilled on the future

- focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on man's search for meaning

  

- responsibleness is the very essence of human existence

  

- its categorical imperative says: "Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now"

  

==

Three Types of Human Wills

1. will to pleasure

2. will to power - striving for superiority

3. will to meaning

  
  

Man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a "secondary rationalization" of instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning.

Statistical Studies:

- 89% admitted that man needs "something" for the sake of which to live

  

- asked what was "very important" to them: 16% answered making a lot of money, and 78% answered finding a purpose and meaning to my life

  

==

Existential Frustration

- struggling to find a concrete meaning in existence

  

- an example can be being employed in a good job, except that it does not give personal satisfaction to you

  

==

Noo-dynamics

- it is the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it

  

==

Existential Vacuum

  

- man has suffered a loss of traditions which supported his behavior

- man has no instinct anymore to tell him what to do, and no tradition to tell him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do

  

- instead, man wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism)

  

- mainly manifests itself in a state of boredom

- may cause depression, addiction, and aggression

- most true for pensioners and aging people

  

- can be wrongly compensated with will to power (focus on money), or the will to pleasure (rampant sexual libido)

  

==

Sunday Neurosis

- the kind of depression where you become aware how empty your true life is when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within yourself manifests

  

==

So What is the Meaning of Life?

  

- it is like asking a chess champion on which is the best move in the world

- the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day, and from hour to hour

- it is the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment

  

- own specific concrete assignment to be fulfilled wherein he cannot be replaced

  

- the true meaning of life cannot be found within man or his own psyche---it is only discovered in the world because being human is always directed to something or someone other than oneself---be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter

  
  

"Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather recognize that it is he who is asked. Each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence."
