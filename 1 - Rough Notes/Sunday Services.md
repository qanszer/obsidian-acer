  - temptations are everywhere, but it is worse to be the temptation of someone

  

b.  Keep myself from stumbling

John the Baptist

- born to old parents

- lives in the wilderness

- Luke 3:1-6

- preaches the repentance of sins

- only baptizes in water (Jesus can baptize in the Holy Spirit)

- best prophet out of all

  

• God is gracious --- even to the ones whose paths are crooked

• Be careful if you are on the backseat, because that is when you are more vulnerable to doubt God like in John's case (Baptizing phase vs. Prison phase)

• You must produce fruit as a result of true repentance, otherwise you would be cut off and thrown to hell

• Do not collect more than you are required to

  

Messiah - savior of the kingdom

Matthew 11

  

• There is heaven above, and heaven here on earth

• Who is the king of your life?

• We are not servants in Jesus' kingdom, we are friends and brothers

  

Kingdom of God - not eating and drinking, but righteousness

Reminder for the week:

Live Out God's Best For Your Life

John 10:10 - thief comes to steal, kill, destroy; Jesus came for us to have an abundant life

  

Abundant "perissos"

Jesus is in control of everything

  

Is your life balanced? Is your life abundant?

Overcoming the Challenge

  

2 Corinthians 10:4

• We demolish: (3 barriers)

 1. strongholds 

 2. arguments - false teachings

 3. pretensions - 

  

take every thought captive to Christ

  
  

- no human being enemies because our fight is not against flesh, but against spiritual forces

  
  

Three Weapons

1. love 

  - soft, tender, and seems weak from the outside

  - love your God and love your neighbor as yourself

  - 21 eyptians martyr incident

  - no fear in love

2. prayer

  

3. truth

  - yes we have answers to honest questions

  - an atheist doctor tried to convince the pastor for an hour that God's existence is not real, but the pastor, with his son, convinced the doctor for 4 hours that God does indeed exist

  
  

- your knees are more powerful than your hands if you believe the power of prayer

- do not use only your hands, but use your knees to shake the nations in prayer

  

romans 10:14

Even Greater

  

Death > Paradise/Hades > Judgement Day > Heaven/Hell

  

Faithing - having faith in God despite continuously failing Him

  

Faith - comes by hearing; do not unplug yourself from God's Word

  

Our future actions is to do Jesus' work and to do even greater things

  

What did Jesus do?

- Heal the sick, raise the dead, perform miracles, etc

- Freely you have received; freely give. (If you have been healed, also pray for healing for others)

- Share the good news

- 1st picture

- 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 All greater things must be rooted in love

- Do greater things with compassion; with love

  

"A ship is always safe at the shore, but it is not what it is built for"

  

How much do you need to give to God?

1. 10%

2. No limit, or generosity

  

Would you choose a 1 million dollars per month job or 30k per month job, but in a nonprofit Christian organization?

  

Our inactions and missed actions are a product of fear - Isaiah 43

  

But the Bible always says, do not fear, do not be anxious about anything, by prayer and petition, with supplication

  

A.S.K.

Ask, Seek, Knock

  

1. Ask and it will be given to you

2. The most important principle in answered prayers is: Pray

3. Prayer shows our faith in Jesus to fulfill His promise
