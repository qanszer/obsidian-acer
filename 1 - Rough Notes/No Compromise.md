  

Know who your boss is. Your real boss, which is God. Like how Daniel served evil kings of Babylon for 70 years, and even gained their favor, but still knew that his real king was God.

  

Work in a manner where others cannot find any ground of accusation to you, because you work in an honest manner that is worthy of God. No negligence, no corruption, no accusation.

  

Proverbs 10:9 NKJV

[9] He who walks with integrity walks securely, But he who perverts his ways will become known.

Questions:

- Did the ISIS really see angelic figures while walking the martyrs?

- What if Daniel died on the lions' den like how the martyrs did?
