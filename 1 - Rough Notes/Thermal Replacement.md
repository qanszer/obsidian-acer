# Thermal Replacement


#### Items to use
- 90% isopropyl alcohol
- appropriate screw drivers
- tweezers
- guitar pick
- tape for removed tape
- anti-static mat/bracelet
- toothbrush/computer cleaning toolkit
- towel rag
- thermal grizzly kryonaut paste


#### Acer A315-44P Specific Notes
- Remove WiFi card first (blocks heatsink access)
- Fan connector is very fragile - be extra gentle
- Heatsink has 4 screws in specific diagonal pattern
- Thermal pad size for VRAM: 15x15x1mm (if present)


#### Screwing Guide
Normal screw behavior:
- Turning clockwise: Steady resistance, then stops firmly
- Feels solid when fully tightened

Stripped screw warning signs:
- Screwdriver slips and won't grip the screw head
- Screw turns but doesn't tighten (keeps spinning freely)
- Metal shavings around screw hole
- Screwdriver feels "loose" in the screw head

What causes stripping:
- Wrong screwdriver size (too big/small)
- Too much force when tightening
- Cross-threading (screw going in crooked)

If you feel this happening:
- STOP immediately
- Back the screw out (turn counter-clockwise)
- Try different screwdriver size
- Start over gently

**Pro Tips for Your Project:**
Screw Technique:
- Start all screws by turning counter-clockwise until you feel a slight "click" (this aligns threads)
- Then turn clockwise slowly
- If it feels wrong, stop and restart



#### Advices from Reddit
- Make sure you disconnect the battery FIRST and NEXT hold the power button for around 10 seconds to burn away all the remaining electric current in the motherboard (so that you won't accidentally short circuit anything). Then you are good to go. If you let a technician do the job they will do the same thing I said. Also don't reuse the old thermal paste and make sure you wipe down all the old residue before applying the new paste.
- Addition: Ground yourself. Some countries will ground your radiators (my country, England does this), as long as you touch a ground every few minutes, you wont short anything out by static.
- While laptops cpu/gpu are (most probably) soldered you could still damage it.  So to prevent that, the trick is heat. So while everybody here is scared about static/ shorting, as long as you are at the same ground level as the parts, don't worry too much about it, so if it's a metal frame, you're fine.  If not, as soon as you remove ONE screw, you are at the same level. (Mostly here, don't do it over carpet and you are fine). How to heat it up?  Turn it on.  And benchmark it for 5 minutes just before and then turn it off.  You should be at the heatsinks before everything has the chance of cooling down enough.

- Use the proper sized screwdriver, so that you don’t strip any screws. May need more than one size…
- Unplug the power cord (duh!) and the battery, once you open the bottom. Be careful disconnecting the battery and wrap the battery connector in electrical tape, to be safe.
- Do not blow fans out and let the free spin. Very bad. I just apply a little pressure with my finger to keep them from free spinning while blowing mine out.
- Be careful removing the thermal paste. There can be little capacitors or resistors around the die (shiny part). Remove thermal paste from cpu/gpu with qtips and plastic tools. Then clean the heatsink side and the actual chips with rubbing alcohol…
- Reconnect the battery. I always hate when I forget to.



#### Steps
1. Remove all metal accessories on yourself. Go shirtless; if you can't wear a cotton top. Do not stand on a carpet. 
2. Turn the laptop off and unplug the AC adapter if it's connected. Wait for 5 minutes.
3. Put the laptop on an anti-static mat, or wear an anti-static bracelet.
4. Take a picture of all screw locations and numbers before removal. Different screw lengths go in different holes. Wrong screw placement can damage the motherboard.
5. If any screw feels stripped, STOP immediately. Take all of the screws off at the bottom of the laptop.
6. Use a guitar pick on the sides to pry up the case and remove it from the laptop.
7. Unplug the battery. Pull the battery plug straight and gently with fingernails on both sides.
8. Take a picture of all screw locations and numbers before removal. Different screw lengths go in different holes. Wrong screw placement can damage the motherboard.
9. If any screw feels stripped, STOP immediately. Remove the screw/s on the wifi card. Slide the card off the motherboard by pulling it gently.
10. Remove any screws and tape on the fan. Don't pull it out because it's connected to the motherboard. Set it aside, and then use the tweezers to push back the end of the fan's cables. If fan cable tears, laptop becomes unusable.
11. Remove the screws on the heatsink. Lift it up from the heatsink and not from the fan to avoid breaking it. If heatsink won't lift easily, check for missed screws/clips.
12. Clean the fan outside with a toothbrush or with a computer brush cleaner. 
13. Clean off any excess on the die as well as on the heatsink, with a 90% isopropyl alcohol sprayed on a towel rag. Check VRAM thermal pads. If they look intact, leave them alone. Only replace if visibly damaged.
14. Use the bought thermal paste. Apply rice grain-sized amount to CPU die center. Let heatsink pressure spread it naturally. DO NOT spread manually with tools. Less is more - excess paste is worse than too little. If thermal paste gets on other components, clean immediately.
15. After placing the thermal paste on the die, put back the heatsink and fan in a straight and careful manner. Screw them back and secure with new electrical tape.
16. Tighten heatsink screws in X-pattern: opposite corners first, then remaining screws. Hand-tight only. Think: Tightening a jar lid just enough so it won't fall off.
17. Reconnect the fan by sliding it inside the connector back in with your finger. This part is important---reconnect the battery by pushing it evenly. Hold both ends with your finger and press it inside in a "pinching" manner.
18. Screw back the case. That's it. Done


#### Testing Protocol
- Boot and immediately check temperatures
- Run stress test (like Prime95) for 10 minutes
- Monitor temps - should be 75-80°C max under load
- If temps still high, disassemble and recheck paste application
