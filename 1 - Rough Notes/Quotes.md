You can't control reality if you can't control yourself.

  
  

Make awkward steps forward, 

Than cowardly steps backward.

  

You don't make choices.

The choices make you.

  

Remove the word 'try' from your vocabulary. Decide if you will do or will not do something.

  

Fast success builds ego.

Slow success builds character.

  

When a man has no purpose in life, 

He distracts himself with pleasure.

  

Idleness is the devil's playground.

  

Make the important things in life seem unimportant, if you want to succeed in your endeavors.

  

My idea is like a match stick. 

It needs to be lit up,

In order for it to produce fire.

  

All people struggle. 

But not all people pity themselves.

  

Without courage, wisdom bears no fruit.

  

Whatever it is that stirs your soul, 

Listen to that. 

Everything else is just noise.

  

Instead of hoping you're doing the right thing, Make it the right thing.

  

You can do hard things. 

Uncertainty is the nature of life, 

But self-trust is the antidote.

  

There is something so surprising about how far you had come, 

Simply by showing up everyday.
