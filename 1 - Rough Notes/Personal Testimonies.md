I lost all hope for my group's CP1 Program Defense when we knew that we wouldn't be able to connect the SQL of our program in time. Meaning, there isn't really any point to our whole interface because it isn't working---there's no code behind them. 

  

We went up and presented our work while expecting several sermons and negativity to be thrown at us for not having a working program, but that wasn't God's plan. They were surprisingly very lenient to our shortcomings, and even praised us alot for the good parts of our work. It's like the very obvious bad parts were invisible. This could only be explained as God's intervention to our situation. Thank you Lord!
