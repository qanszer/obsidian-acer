PONTRI'S PERSONAL POINTERS for Muscular Development (first in a series)

  

SUBJECT: Guaranteed Growth Guidelines

for ECTOMORPHS (thin-boned hardgainers...like me.)

  
  

• use freeweights (barbells/dumbbells) instead of machines  (Note: dumbbells if nursing an injury or correcting imbalances)

  

• prefer compound exercises to isolation movements

  

• always reach failure (temporary muscle failure) especially on the last set of each exercise

  

• for your muscle-gaining phase, choose a load that will allow you to reach only 8 to 12 reps max (light enough for you to reach that range, yet heavy enough that you cannot go over that range). Also, don't rely on a spotter to reach 8 to 12 reps.

  

• during each repetition, the load must travel through the FULL RANGE OF MOTION (all the way up, all the way down)

  

• observe strict/proper form. DO NOT USE MOMENTUM OR UNNECESSARY SWINGING TO MOVE THE LOAD. Additional muscles should not be recruited when lifting (example: don't bounce legs when hitting shoulders or biceps). The primary/secondary target muscles alone must do all the work.

  

• control rep speed. during EACH repetition, the positive (concentric) phase must take about 2 seconds, the negative (eccentric) phase should last 3-4 seconds!

  

• when lifting heavy, rest AT LEAST 2 minutes between sets so you can lift much heavier loads in the succeeding set

  

• do pyramid or straight sets

  

• if your program has a day when you train 2 to 3 bodyparts in one session, hit the larger parts first before the medium & smaller ones (e.g. chest, then shoulders, then triceps)

  

• limit TOTAL sets per bodypart to not more than 14 total sets for each large muscle, and a maximum of 10 total sets for each small muscle

  

• try to finish your weight-training session in 120 minutes (excluding warm-up/cooldown)

  

• consume fast-acting carbs (high-glycemic) like ripe bananas, dextrose powder, etc. along with easy-to-digest protein ...IMMEDIATELY AFTER training

  

• limit weekly cardio

  

• sleep 7 to 8 hours daily, and allot time for rest/relaxation

  

• everyday, eat a meal/snack (that contains protein) EVERY 3 to 4 hours

  

• for advanced bodybuilders, train each large bodypart only once every 5 to 6 days (small bodyparts only once every 4 to 6 days) to avoid overtraining

  

• CHANGE YOUR PROGRAM EVERY 2 TO 3 MONTHS!  Do this by altering the exercises, or the order of the exercises, or the bodypart combinations, or the volume/intensity, or the rest between sets, or the rep speed, etc.). The routine modification will depend on:  your new personal goal;  the changes in your body fat % or composition;  how often you can workout per week;  your other activities outside the gym;  which stale exercises need to be replaced with fresh movements;  what weak bodyparts did not improve after completing your last program;  or the new supplements you plan to use.

  

• to avoid plateaus, vary programs from heavy phase (muscle-building tips outlined above) to light phase, or vice versa

  

• commit your entire bodybuilding quest to God...obey HIM, the Creator your body!

  
  

Sincerely yours in fitness & in health,
