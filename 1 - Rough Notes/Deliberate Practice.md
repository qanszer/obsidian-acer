  

Deliberate Practice, or "serious study alone", is crucial for exponential improvement on anything. 

  

Work is good. It gives a sense of achievement, direction, and meaning in one's life. What is my work right now?

  

I want to become a full-stack web developer as a freelancer.



Deliberate Practice

- people who practice alone are usually the ones who excel the most in what they practice in

- athletes, chess players, instrumentalists, etc who excel in their craft have done long amounts of self-practice

- "serious study alone" gives you deeper focus, as well as the choice to choose which areas to improve on
