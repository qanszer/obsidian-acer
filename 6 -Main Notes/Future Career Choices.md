- Platform Engineer - Building internal tools and infrastructure
- Infrastructure Engineer - Managing servers, networks, deployment systems

**Low-moderate interaction:**

- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) - Some incident response communication, but mostly system monitoring

- Developer Experience Engineer - Building tools for other developers, limited external interaction

**Worth noting:**

- Principal/Staff Engineer roles vary widely - some companies expect them to be very collaborative, others let them focus more on deep technical work
- Security roles can range from highly technical (penetration testing, security research) to very collaborative (compliance, risk management)
- Specialized backend roles in larger companies often have less cross-team interaction
