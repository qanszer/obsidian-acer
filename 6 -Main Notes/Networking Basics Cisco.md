# Networking Basics Cisco


## *Module 1*

#### Network Types

The internet is not owned by any individual or group.
It is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internet for short), exchanging information using common standards.

The **internet** is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers worldwide.
Users can do it through **telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links**.


**Small home networks** connect a few computers to each other and to the internet.

**SOHO network or Small Office/Home Office network** allows users in a home/remote office to connect to a corporate network, as well as access centralized, shared resources.

**Medium to large networks**, like those used by corporations and schools, can have many locations with thousands of interconnected hosts. 


Devices connected to the internet:
- mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, smart glasses
- cctv security system, appliances, smart TV, gaming consoles
- smart cars, RFID tags (physical tracking), sensors, actuators, medical devices


#### Data Transmission

Types of personal data:

- **Volunteered Data** - data you willingly and explicitly shared; something you typed yourself and put out in the internet. this type of data might include video files, pictures, texts, or audio.
- **Observed Data** - data captured by recording the actions of individuals, such as location data when using cell phones.
- **Inferred Data** - data based on the analysis of volunteered and observed data, such as a credit score.


Bit is an abbreviation of "binary digit" and represents the smallest piece of data (0 and 1).


3 Common methods of signal transmission in networks:

- **Electrical Signals** - transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- **Optical Signals** - converts the electrical signals into light pulses.
- **Wireless Signals** - uses infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.


#### Bandwidth and Throughput

Bandwidth - the theoretical maximum capacity of a connection to carry data; typically measured in the number of bits per second (bps)

- kbps - thousands of bits per second
- mbps - millions
- gbps - billions

Throughput - the actual, measured rate at which data is successfully transferred over a network within a given time period; it is the practical measure of data transfer, taking into account real-world factors like network congestion, errors, and latency.

Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.




## *Module 2*

#### Clients and Servers

Computers are hosts which can either be a client, server, both.

All computers connected to a network are classified as hosts. Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both---the software installed on the computer determines which role it plays.

P2P network or Peer to Peer network is the type of network where computers function as both the client and server. This is common in small businesses and homes. They are:

- easy to set up
- less complex
- less cost
- can be used for simple tasks like transferring files and sharing printers.
- no centralized administration
- less security
- not scalable
- performs slower

Because of the potential for high amounts of network traffic, it is often necessary for larger businesses to have dedicated servers to support the number of service requests. 


#### Network Components

Network infrastructure
- the platform that supports the network
- provides the stable and reliable channel over which communications can occur
- contacts 3 categories of hardware components: **end devices, intermediate devices, and network media**

Hardware is the visible components of the network platform like the laptop, PC, switch, router, wireless access point, and the cabling used.

Wireless media are the components that are not visible.

End devices, or hosts, form the interface between users. Examples include:
- computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
- network printers
- telephones
- security cam
- mobile devices


#### ISP Connectivity Options

An ISP or Internet Service Provider provides the link between home network and the internet which can be:
- local cable provider
- landline telephone service provider
- cellular network provider

Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network of links that interconnects users all over the world. 
It also ensures that internet traffic takes the shortest path possible from the source to the destination.

Different methods in connecting to the ISP:
- cable
- DSL (uses regular telephone lines)
- cellular
- satellite
- dial-up telephone



## Module 3

#### Wireless Networks

GPS or Global Positioning System
- uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe

Wi-Fi
- Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers located within the smartphone enable the phone to connect to local networks and the internet

Hotspot
- an area where Wi-Fi signals are available

Bluetooth
- a low-power, shorter range wireless technology that is intended to replace wired connectivity for accessories such as speakers, headphones, and microphones

Near Field Communication (NFC)
- is a wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in very close proximity to each other
- uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data
- used for payment systems
