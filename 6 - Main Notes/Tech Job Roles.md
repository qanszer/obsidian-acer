**Worth noting:**

- Principal/Staff Engineer roles vary widely - some companies expect them to be very collaborative, others let them focus more on deep technical work
- Security roles can range from highly technical (penetration testing, security research) to very collaborative (compliance, risk management)
- Specialized backend roles in larger companies often have less cross-team interaction
