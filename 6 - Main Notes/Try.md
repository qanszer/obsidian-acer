**Purpose:** Engage, connect, and establish
**Suggestions:** Ask a question, share a personal experience, or tell a funny story
**Objective:** They should think, "I want to listen to this"


### B. Need

*"Why do I need to listen to you?"*

**Suggestions:**
1. Know their struggles related to the topic
2. Paint the picture why they can't stay where they are
3. Cast the vision on where they could be

**Objective:** They should think, "I need to listen to this"


### C. Text

*"What is God saying to me?"*

A devotion must be simple and deep. At the same time, the objective should be conviction and conversion.


### D. Application

*"How should I apply this in my life?"*

**Guidelines:** Relevant, attainable, and specific
**Objective:** They should think, "I know exactly what I should do"


### E. Challenge

# Homiletics on Matthew 28:18-20

*18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. 19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. 20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."*
