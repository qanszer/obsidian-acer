# Hermeneutics on Matthew 28:19-20

> 
> *18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. 19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. 20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."*

#### 1. PRAY

God’s Word is supernatural. 
We cannot understand it without the help of its Author—God.


#### 2. CONTEXT


**Author:** Matthew
- One of the twelve apostles of Jesus who was a former tax collector

**Audience:** Jewish Christians
- This is evident in his use of Jewish terminology and customs without explanation

**Settings of Author:** Possibly Antioch
- Scholars had varied conclusions on this 

**Settings of Audience:** Destruction of the Jerusalem Temple
- The original audience lived in a time of transition—after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in AD 70, which intensified tensions between Jews and Jewish Christians
- Many Jews rejected Jesus as Messiah, and early believers faced pressure to conform to either Rabbinic Judaism or Greco-Roman paganism

**Theme:** The Great Commission
- Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, through baptizing and teaching them to obey everything He commanded


#### 3. OBSERVATION


**I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth**

- It is the same idea as if a lieutenant in the military reminded a private of his rank before he gave an order
- This indicates that this is a **command**, and not a suggestion


**Therefore, go**

- Because Jesus has this authority, we are **therefore** commanded to **go**


**Make disciples of all the nations**

- The command is to **make disciples**, not merely converts or supporters of a cause
- The phrase **make disciples** reminds us that disciples are _made_. **Disciples** are not spontaneously created at conversion; they are the product of a process involving other believers. This making of **disciples** is the power of spreading Christianity.


**Of all the nations**

- Jesus deliberately restricted His work to the Jewish people and previously sent His disciples with the same restriction
- Only in rare exceptions did Jesus minister among the Gentiles
- Now, Jesus commanded the disciples to take the gospel to **all the nations**
	- On this point I had a question, *"Why did Jesus deliberately restrict His ministry to the Jews only at first?"*
	- It was apparently to fulfill specific theological, prophetic, and strategic purposes. You can search it up yourself for more details


**Baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit**

- Significantly, when Jesus told them to go to all the nations, He did not tell them to _circumcise_ those who became disciples. Instead, they were to baptize them, suggesting the break with traditional Judaism.
- Those who favor infant baptism answer, albeit unconvincingly: “But it doth not therefore follow, that children of such professors are not to be baptized, for the apostles were commanded to baptize _all nations_; children are a great part of any nation.”
- The words and context certainly indicate that it is **disciples** who are baptized, those of age who can be taught and who can observe the things Jesus commanded.


**Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you**

- Disciples are **made** through **teaching**
- When Jesus says to **"teach them to obey ALL the commands I have given you,"** He means:
	1. **All His ethical teachings** (Sermon on the Mount, love God and neighbor, etc.)
	2. **All His doctrinal teachings** (about Himself, the Father, the Spirit, salvation, judgment, etc.)
	3. **All His practical instructions** (prayer, fasting, dealing with conflict, money, etc.)
	4. **All His warnings** (against hypocrisy, legalism, self-righteousness, hell, etc.)


**I am with you always, even to the end of the age**

- Jesus sent us, His disciples, with a mission to fulfill, but He did not send us alone
- This means that we certainly work _for_ Jesus, but more than that, we work _with_ Jesus. Every step of the way.
