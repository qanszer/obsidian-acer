# Eli&Sevs Archive

Planning/list of my personal website with Eli

### Current Features

1. Hero section
2. Light/dark mode
3. Navigation side section
4. Navbar


### Future Features

- Relationship highlights/timeline
- Best pictures together
- Collection of gifts received from each other
- Places visited

### Ideas

- **Jar of Questions.** (When we first started dating, we each came up with interesting questions and I wrote them down and put them in a jar. We both loved pulling a question from the jar and discussing. They could be deep questions, silly would you rather questions, anything you can think of!)
- **Couples Bucket List** (He saw this idea on a blog somewhere, so we created a Google Doc and we made a giant list of all the things we want to do together. We did this pretty early on and have crossed quite a few things off! We've also added to it quite a bit. It has different sections too, like movies we want to watch, dates we want to go on, places we want to visit, etc. I write mine in pink and he writes his in red.)
	- We will have a bucket list of all the things we want to do, wherein you can click an item for more details like pics/vids, or if done or not etc
- **Timeline** (We haven't done this yet, but it's a project we both want to do at some point. Basically, each of you create a timeline of the important moments of your life. Birth to present. Include the things that really impacted you - good things and bad. Then, you each share the timeline of your life with each other.)
- **Letters** (with recorded audio, can add a background music too for a dramatic effect)


## Categories to Cover (helps you think systematically)

**Physical/Appearance** (20-30 reasons)

- Specific features you love (her smile, eyes, laugh, the way she does something)
- How she looks in certain situations (when she's focused, sleeping, getting ready)

**Personality Traits** (40-50 reasons)

- Her kindness, humor, intelligence, creativity, determination, etc.
- How she handles challenges, treats others, makes decisions

**Things She Does** (50-60 reasons)

- Little habits or quirks (how she drinks coffee, her morning routine)
- Ways she shows love or care
- Talents or skills she has

**How She Makes You Feel** (40-50 reasons)

- Emotions she brings out in you
- Ways she's changed or improved your life
- Comfort/safety/happiness she provides

**Specific Memories** (30-40 reasons)

- Dates or moments that meant something
- Times she surprised you or made you laugh
- Challenges you faced together

**Inside Jokes/Shared Experiences** (20-30 reasons)

- References only you two understand
- Running gags or recurring funny moments

**Her Impact on Others** (15-20 reasons)

- Why you see a future with her

**Simple/Sweet Daily Things** (50-60 reasons)

- Her voice, the way she texts, her hugs
- Comfort things (her presence, her support)
- Small gestures she might not even notice she does

### Pro Tips for Writing Them

- **Be specific over generic**: "I love how you scrunch your nose when you're confused" beats "you're cute"
- **Mix deep with light**: Balance heavy emotional ones with fun/silly ones
- **Use "the way you..."** as a template: "the way you always remember my coffee order"
- **Reference real moments**: "Remember when you... that's when I knew..."
- **Vary the length**: Some can be 3 words, others can be a full sentence
- **Include sensory details**: sounds, smells, touches, sights
- **Don't overthink it**: If it made you smile thinking about her, write it down

### Quick Exercise

Set a timer for 10 minutes and just rapid-fire list anything about her. Don't edit, just write. You'll be surprised how many you get.

Once you have your 365 reasons ready, let me know and I'll build the app for you!

## 2026 Valentine's Poem

Naalala ko pa nung first date natin, kilig to the bones, 
Ngayon monthsary na natin, 31 months, ang tagal nons! 
Playful at childish ka pag magkasama tayo, 
'Yan ang parte na favorite ko, walang kupas, laging bago.

Bonds mo ng friends mo, solid at totoo, 
Proactive ka pa, 'di ka nagpapabaya sa kanila, bro.
Matalino ka sa pera, 'di basta-bastang gumagastos, 
Pero generous ka magmahal sakin, walang tapos.

Nag-orgs ka pa, at self-improvement, goals mo'y matataas, 
Proud ako sa'yo, baby, ang galing mo, lampas na lampas!
You face problems head-on, with innovative solutions, wow, 
Wala akong solution, pero ikaw, alam mo paano, pow!

Tumatawa ka sa jokes ko kahit corny, salamat, 
Sweet mo talaga, Eli, mga araw ko'y iyong lagi'y inaangat!
LDR man tayo, Bohol ka, Manila ako,
Pero worth it lang, kasi ikaw ang minamahal ko!

Maalaga ka sa mga pusa, kay Crinkles lalo na,
Pero ako na bahala sa pusa mo, didiligan ko siya lagi nang masagana
Memory gold mo, grabe, 'di nakakalimot, 
Random GIFs mo sa chat, nakakatawa, 'di ko malilimot. 

Lahat ng lugar na napuntahan natin, just us two, 
Naka-store sa puso ko, patootie, ikaw lang, walang iba, it's true.
Plano na natin ang future, pamilya, bahay, lahat na, 
Excited na ako, baby, pero for now, LDR muna, haha!

Kaya nag-code ako ng 365 Reasons app para sa'yo, 
Para araw-araw, alam mong mahal na mahal kita, baby boo. 
Pink at white theme, favorite colors mo, check!
Effort ko 'to, love, sana magustuhan mo, 'wag mo ireject!

Alam kong busy tayo ngayon, college life, grind mode on, 
Pero ikaw pa rin priority ko, 'di kita iiwan, I promise, hon. 
Valentine's natin, LDR man, special pa rin 'to, 
Kasi ikaw, Eli, ang tanging mahal ko, alam mo 'to!

Mahal kita, baby, walang kupas, walang humpay, 
365 reasons, kulang pa 'yan, dapat habang buhay!
Salamat sa lahat, sa tawa, sa lambing, sa effort mo, 
Ikaw lang forever, walang iba, mahal kita you know!


From your Dearest Programmer/One-Time Poet
