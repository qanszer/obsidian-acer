## Categories to Cover (helps you think systematically)

**How She Makes You Feel** (40-50 reasons)

**Specific Memories** (30-40 reasons)

- Dates or moments that meant something
- Times she surprised you or made you laugh
- Challenges you faced together

**Inside Jokes/Shared Experiences** (20-30 reasons)

## Pro Tips for Writing Them

- **Be specific over generic**: "I love how you scrunch your nose when you're confused" beats "you're cute"
- **Mix deep with light**: Balance heavy emotional ones with fun/silly ones
- **Use "the way you..."** as a template: "the way you always remember my coffee order"
- **Reference real moments**: "Remember when you... that's when I knew..."
- **Vary the length**: Some can be 3 words, others can be a full sentence
- **Include sensory details**: sounds, smells, touches, sights
- **Don't overthink it**: If it made you smile thinking about her, write it down

## Quick Exercise

Set a timer for 10 minutes and just rapid-fire list anything about her. Don't edit, just write. You'll be surprised how many you get.

Once you have your 365 reasons ready, let me know and I'll build the app for you!
