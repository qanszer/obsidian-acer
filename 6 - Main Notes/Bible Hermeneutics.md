It is to properly interpret, understand, and apply God’s Word.

> *Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.*
> 
> *2 Timothy 2:15*

## STEPS IN INTERPRETING THE BIBLE


#### 1. PRAY

God’s Word is supernatural. 
We cannot understand it without the help of its Author—God.


#### 2. CONTEXT

**There are 4 barriers in interpreting the Bible:**
-  Time
-  Language
-  Geography
-  Culture

**Useful websites for knowing in-depth context:**
1. Bible.org
2. Gotquestions.org
3. Gty.org (Grace to You)
4. Biblegateway.com
5. Biblehub.com

##### 2 Methods - Extensive and Shorter Version

**Extensive Version**

**Who?**
- Who is the author of the book?
- To whom is the book/letter/epistle for? To whom is the author speaking?
- Who are the people/characters involved?

**What?**
- What is being discussed throughout the chapter?
- What happened before and after the chapter?
- What is the situation of the people/government/place the people are in?
- What is happening during the time it was written?

**When?**
- When is the text written?
- Is the text addressed in the past, present, or the future? (e.g. Revelations)

**Where?**
- Where was the author when he wrote the epistle/book/letter?
- Where is the letter addressed to?
- What is happening in the place where the letter was addressed to? (e.g. In the book of Ephesians, what is happening to the believers in Ephesus?)

**Why?**
- Why was the epistle/book/letter written?
	Which of these:
		- encouragement?
		- rebuke?
		- teach?
		- tell the story of the past?
		- inform?
		- exhort?
		- other reason?

##### EXAMPLE CONTEXT OF PHILIPPIANS 4:6-7
- **Author**: Apostle Paul
- **Audience**: Believers of Jesus Christ in Philippi

#### 3. OBSERVATION

##### **Things to look for:**
- Key repeated words
- Comparisons/contrast
- Cause and consequences
- Conjunctions
- Tense
- Prescription (to command)?
- Description (to inform)?
- Cause and Effect
- Conclusion
- Reason/Purpose

**Descriptive** - the Bible is just simply describing it, but not commanding us to do it.

*Acts 18:18 Before he sailed, he had his hair* *cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he* *had taken.*

**Prescriptive** - the Bible is commanding/telling us to do it.

*Ephesians 5:18 Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to deauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit...*


**Indicative mood** - a simple statement of fact. If an action really occurs or has occured or will occur.

*1 Peter 5:8 Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.*

**Subjunctive mood** - the mood of possibility and
potentiality.

*1 Peter 5:8 Be alert and of sober mind. Your*
*enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring*
*lion looking for someone to devour.*


##### EXAMPLE OBSERVATION OF PHILIPPIANS 4:6-7

**Do not be anxious** = command
**but** = contrast of worrying
**Every situation** = good or bad
**Prayer and petition**
**With thanksgiving**
**present your** = matters that are personal, things that
**makes you worry**
**requests** = plural
**to God** = not to your mom, not to your friends
**peace of God** = not just an ordinary peace (Supernatural Peace)


#### 4. INTERPRETATION

##### EXAMPLE INTERPRETATION OF PHILIPPIANS 4:6-7

- We are commanded by God not to worry (it’s
- a sin to worry)
- Instead, we are commanded by God to pray
- specific prayers (with thanksgiving)
- As a result, His peace will guard our hearts
- and minds

#### 5. APPLICATION

No matter the complexity of your devotion, if there is no application, then it is useless - always ask the question, **“what now?”**

##### EXAMPLE APPLICATION OF PHILIPPIANS 4:6-7

- When there’s a tempting situation, pause and pray immediately.
- Pray specific prayers, not general prayers. 
- Have the attitude of thanksgiving when giving your requests to God.
