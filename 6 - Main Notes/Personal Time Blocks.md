# Daily Time Blocks

## Morning (6:30 AM - 9:00 AM)

**Mindset:** Start the day at your own pace. If you wake before the alarm, get up—fragmented sleep won't help.

2. Take a bath
3. Check rice situation; cook if needed
4. Tackle household tasks (reference task manager)
5. Breakfast
6. Open time: bebetime, reading, catching up on to-do's, or social time with friends
