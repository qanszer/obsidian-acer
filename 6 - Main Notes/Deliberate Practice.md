# Deliberate Practice


Deliberate Practice, or "serious study alone", is crucial for exponential improvement on anything. 

Work is good. It gives a sense of achievement, direction, and meaning in one's life. 

What is my work right now? Nothing yet, but I currently want to become a web developer.


People who practice alone are usually the ones who excel the most in what they practice in

Athletes, chess players, instrumentalists, etc who excel in their craft have done long amounts of self-practice

"Serious study alone" gives you deeper focus, as well as the choice to choose which areas to improve on
