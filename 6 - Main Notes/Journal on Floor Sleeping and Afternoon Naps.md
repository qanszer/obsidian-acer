# Journal on Floor Sleeping and Afternoon Naps

This is a journal to my "sleeping on the floor" journey as well as a little addition for my afternoon naps. I'm starting both of these because I'm after their supposed benefits, which outweigh the weird and unconventional nature of it.


### 2/15/26 - Setting it up

My current setup is a yoga mat underneath and a comforter. The feel is pretty good right now, I'll see when I try to sleep for the first night tonight.

I slept in the afternoon around 3:30pm for 1 hour. When I woke up, I felt groggy and sleepy, and ended up sleeping for 3 more hours making it 4 hours total. Crazy.

### 2/16/26 - Rough but great start

It worked. I immediately got up after my alarm. 
I feel energized to boot, not groggy. 
I ended up having a productive morning because of it (barley, laundry, withdraw and buy banana, bath, etc)

My only concern is my quality of sleep. I probably did not get much or any REM sleep at all, because I kept waking up for 1-3 seconds throughout my sleep (maybe 5-10 times total). 

I had an afternoon nap for 30 minutes this time, I forgot the time. I still felt groggy and sleepy, but ended up pushing through in continuing my day. It felt like it had more negatives than positives honestly.

### 2/17/26 - New addition

The night before, I put ate's comforter(?) as a new layer to my floor bed. So it got thicker, but it was still weirdly kind of hard to the back.

Bad sleep. The duration of the times I woke up were longer, and my body felt sore the whole time. I don't know if this was due to my workout soreness or my sleep soreness, but it's probably the former. 

When the alarm rang, I did not get up immediately. I felt energized and awake, but also rebellious because of the quality of my sleep. I even almost fell back asleep but then decided not to and got up after around 8 minutes of waking up.

I did not get to have an afternoon nap today. I missed the timing because of my leisure time on my laptop.

### 2/18/26 - Fell off a little

I slept late at 1:30am because I helped Eli on her acads by making a reviewer. As if a domino effect, I ended up not doing any of my night routine, including sleeping on the floor. I got too lazy of setting up my bed, and I wanted a straight sleep. So I slept on the couch.

I slept soundly, but woke up with a headache on the back of my head, to which I don't know why. The alertness is still here though surprisingly.

I'll sleep back on the floor tonight.

I missed my afternoon nap for today because I was busy making my contemp assignment.

### 2/19/26 - Fell off by A LOT but best sleep so far

I ended up sleeping at around 5:30am because I was remaking the design for my parents' brochure for the business. I was tempted to sleep on the couch again, but I pushed through and set up my floor bed.

I was surprised. It was the best sleep I've had in the floor for a while now. I did not wake up a single moment until 12:00pm. 

Either my late sleep was the factor of change, or it was the extra layer I had from ate's comforter(?) that I only appreciated now.

No afternoon nap again

### 2/20/26 - Great sleep continued

I slept at around 12:30am this time due to doomscrolling Stephano's vids. I enjoyed his vids too much. My sleep was great nonetheless. The only problem was that when I woke up, I got tempted to watch his vids again, and I really did for the first hour of my waking. 

No afternoon nap

### 2/21/26 - Great sleep, bad wake-up discipline

Great news, I finally slept in the afternoon. It did not go as planned though.

I first tried sleeping on top ate's bunk bed because I didn't want to sleep on david's bed, and my bed has to be set up which I was too lazy to do. I did not get a good rest there. I was half-asleep for the whole duration due to the many disturbances. It was like this until the 20-min alarm came. It wasn't even 20 minutes yet; my analog alarm clock is broken. 

Unsatisfied, I tried sleeping while sitting on my table next. I used to do this in RCS because they had a dedicated 30-min siesta time. I did not think much of it but that really was a healthy habit system they built. My classmates and friends wouldn't sleep during those times, but I did and now I got inspired by it. And it was successful; I got the afternoon nap I wanted. Except my head hurts and I did not like that. I got up and half-asleep went to david's bed and slept on it improperly (diagonal with my legs still on the floor). 

In the end I slept best there, but I slept for 1hr 30min total because of that whole ordeal. And it even ended past 3pm, which is not good and will affect my night time sleep. Meh, it is what it is. At least I finally slept in the afternoon again. I'll try to stick to 20-30min regardless of anything tomorrow.

As for my sleep last night, it was great. No problems at all and it was of decent quality. The only problem again was my motivation and discipline to get up immediately did not appear, which made me doomscroll for 3 hours total on the bed. Bad start for sure but I ended up being productive for the rest of my day's hours anyway so it's all good.

### 2/22/26

Great night sleep haha. Setting up the bed is much faster now; found a good method in doing it. I'll probably drop on mentioning my night sleeps at this point because it's been a smooth ride now. 

My afternoon naps are the problem. I napped in the afternoon again, and it got worse. My 25 minute alarm was not heard at all (prob because I'm in the living room and it was noisy here), and turned into a 4-5 hour sleep. Crazy. I woke up at 5:30pm. Crazyyyy

### 2/23/26

Great night sleep, bad start of the day again.

Tried to nap in the afternoon but didn't work out.
