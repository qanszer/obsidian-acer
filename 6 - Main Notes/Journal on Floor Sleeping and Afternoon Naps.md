# Journal on Floor Sleeping and Afternoon Naps


### 2/15/26 - Setting it up

My current setup is a yoga mat underneath and a comforter. The feel is pretty good right now, I'll see when I try to sleep for the first night tonight.

I slept in the afternoon around 3:30pm for 1 hour. When I woke up, I felt groggy and sleepy, and ended up sleeping for 3 more hours making it 4 hours total. Crazy.

### 2/16/26

It worked. I immediately got up after my alarm. 
I feel energized to boot, not groggy. 
I ended up having a productive morning because of it (barley, laundry, withdraw and buy banana, bath, etc)

My only concern is my quality of sleep. I probably did not get much or any REM sleep at all, because I kept waking up for 1-3 seconds throughout my sleep (maybe 5-10 times total). 

I had an afternoon nap for 30 minutes this time, I forgot the time. I still felt groggy and sleepy, but ended up pushing through in continuing my day. It felt like it had more negatives than positives honestly.

### 2/17/26

The night before, I put ate's comforter(?) as a new layer to my floor bed. So it got thicker, but it was still weirdly kind of hard to the back.

Bad sleep. The duration of the times I woke up were longer, and my body felt sore the whole time. I don't know if this was due to my workout soreness or my sleep soreness, but it's probably the former. 

When the alarm rang, I did not get up immediately. I felt energized and awake, but also rebellious because of the quality of my sleep. I even almost fell back asleep but then decided not to and got up after around 8 minutes of waking up.

I did not get to have an afternoon nap today. I missed the timing because of my leisure time on my laptop.

### 2/18/26

I slept late at 1:30am because I helped Eli on her acads by making a reviewer. As if a domino effect, I ended up not doing any of my night routine, including sleeping on the floor. I got too lazy of setting up my bed, and I wanted a straight sleep. So I slept on the couch.

I slept soundly, but woke up with a headache on the back of my head, to which I don't know why. The alertness is still here though surprisingly.

I'll sleep back on the floor tonight.

I missed my afternoon nap for today because I was busy making my contemp assignment.

### 2/19/26

I ended up sleeping at around 5:30am because I was remaking the design for my parents' brochure for the business. I was tempted to sleep on the couch again, but I pushed through and set up my floor bed.

I was surprised. It was the best sleep I've had in the floor for a while now. I did not wake up a single moment until 12:00pm. 

Either my late sleep was the factor of change, or it was the extra layer I had from ate's comforter(?) that I only appreciated now.

No afternoon nap again

### 2/20/26

I slept at around 12:30am this time due to doomscrolling Stephano's vids. I enjoyed his vids too much. My sleep was great nonetheless. The only problem was that when I woke up, I got tempted to watch his vids again, and I really did for the first hour of my waking.
