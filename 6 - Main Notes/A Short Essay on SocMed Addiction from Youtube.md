# A Short Essay on SocMed Addiction from Youtube

You woke up. It's the weekends, and you have all of today for yourself. You decide to check your phone right after waking up. Bored, you go to youtube or any other social media. Before you know it, 4 hours passed by just like that. And you can't even recall clearly what you did or watched during those 4 hours.

Social media addiction is hard to get rid of. Why? Because you're against companies who spend 700 billion dollars annually total just to keep your attention and time stuck on them. They hire the same people who make gambling so addicting to many people. Add to the fact that social media doesn't make you lose money like gambling, albeit not directly, making it more prone for addiction to a wider audience than gambling. 

A doctor from Stanford medical school calls social media addiction 'digital heroin'. It even has withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, depression, and inability to focus. That same school, Stanford, led a study on how to overcome social media addiction. Their results shows that one of the best methods to do so is to be a creator instead of a consumer. 

When you create, you start getting a healthy dosage of dopamine in the natural way. And it is possible with any type of creation. Whether it is by forming a single paragraph, drawing a doodle, cooking food, coding a simple program, or anything similar would get you the same healthy results.

So when you catch yourself wanting to mindlessly doomscroll or spend time in consuming content, do a single paragraph, draw a doodle, or code, etc. Doing this all the time will reap you great results in the long run that is hard to describe with words for me, apparently.

But throughout this change, a very important aspect of it is your mindset. It is not a changing of the habit, but a changing of your identity. You're not just lessening your hours from being a social media consumer, you're now a creator. From a mindset of consumer to a mindset that you're a creator of anything you like.

To boot, because this current society has countless consumer mindsets, the creators usually have the most benefits.
