## Ecclesiastes

### Chapter 1

**Ecclesiastes 1:1-11 NLT**
[1] These are the words of the Teacher, King David’s son, who ruled in Jerusalem.  [2] “Everything is meaningless,” says the Teacher, “completely meaningless!” [3] What do people get for all their hard work under the sun? [4] Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes. [5] The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again. [6] The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles. [7] Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea. [8] Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content. [9] History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new. [10] Sometimes people say, “Here is something new!” But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new. [11] We don’t remember what happened in the past, and in future generations, no one will remember what we are doing now. 


These are the words of the Teacher, King David’s son, who ruled in Jerusalem Everything is meaningless, says the Teacher, completely meaningless What do people get for all their hard work under the sun?  Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes.  The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again.  The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles.  Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea.  Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content.  History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new.  Sometimes people say, “Here is something new!” But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new.  We don’t remember what happened in the past, and in future generations, no one will remember what we are doing now. Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone’s duty.  God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad.

**Ecclesiastes 1:12-17 NLT**
[12] I, the Teacher, was king of Israel, and I lived in Jerusalem. [13] I devoted myself to search for understanding and to explore by wisdom everything being done under heaven. I soon discovered that God has dealt a tragic existence to the human race. [14] I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind. [15] What is wrong cannot be made right. What is missing cannot be recovered. [16] I said to myself, “Look, I am wiser than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have greater wisdom and knowledge than any of them.” [17] So I set out to learn everything from wisdom to madness and folly. But I learned firsthand that pursuing all this is like chasing the wind.

**Ecclesiastes 1:18 NLT**
[18] The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief. To increase knowledge only increases sorrow.

### Chapter 2

**Ecclesiastes 2:1-3 NLT**
[1] I said to myself, “Come on, let’s try pleasure. Let’s look for the ‘good things’ in life.” But I found that this, too, was meaningless. [2] So I said, “Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?” [3] After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.

**Ecclesiastes 2:8-11 NLT**
[8] I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire! [9] So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and my wisdom never failed me. [10] Anything I wanted, I would take. I denied myself no pleasure. I even found great pleasure in hard work, a reward for all my labors. [11] But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless—like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere. 

**Ecclesiastes 2:13-16 NLT**
[13] I thought, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. [14] For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate. [15] Both will die. So I said to myself, “Since I will end up the same as the fool, what’s the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!” [16] For the wise and the foolish both die. The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool. In the days to come, both will be forgotten.

**Ecclesiastes 2:17 NLT**
[17] So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling. Everything is meaningless—like chasing the wind. 

**Ecclesiastes 2:24-26 NLT**
[24] So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God. [25] For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him? [26] God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. This, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind.

### Chapter 3

**Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 NLT**
[1] For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven. [2] A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest. [3] A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to tear down and a time to build up. [4] A time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance. [5] A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones. A time to embrace and a time to turn away. [6] A time to search and a time to quit searching. A time to keep and a time to throw away. [7] A time to tear and a time to mend. A time to be quiet and a time to speak. [8] A time to love and a time to hate. A time for war and a time for peace.

**Ecclesiastes 3:11 NLT**
[11] Yet God has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart, but even so, people cannot see the whole scope of God’s work from beginning to end. 

**Ecclesiastes 3:12-13 NLT**
[12] So I concluded there is nothing better than to be happy and enjoy ourselves as long as we can. [13] And people should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of their labor, for these are gifts from God.

**Ecclesiastes 3:14 NLT**
[14] And I know that whatever God does is final. Nothing can be added to it or taken from it. God’s purpose is that people should fear him. 

**Ecclesiastes 3:16-17 NLT**
[16] I also noticed that under the sun there is evil in the courtroom. Yes, even the courts of law are corrupt! [17] I said to myself, “In due season God will judge everyone, both good and bad, for all their deeds.”

**Ecclesiastes 3:22 NLT**
[22] So I saw that there is nothing better for people than to be happy in their work. That is our lot in life. And no one can bring us back to see what happens after we die.

### Chapter 4

**Ecclesiastes 4:1 NLT**
[1] Again, I observed all the oppression that takes place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, with no one to comfort them. The oppressors have great power, and their victims are helpless. 

**Ecclesiastes 4:4 NLT**
[4] Then I observed that most people are motivated to success because they envy their neighbors. But this, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind.

**Ecclesiastes 4:8 NLT**
[8] This is the case of a man who is all alone, without a child or a brother, yet who works hard to gain as much wealth as he can. But then he asks himself, “Who am I working for? Why am I giving up so much pleasure now?” It is all so meaningless and depressing.

**Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 NLT**
[9] Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. [10] If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble. [11] Likewise, two people lying close together can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone? [12] A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken. 

### Chapter 5

**Ecclesiastes 5:1-2 NLT**
[1]  As you enter the house of God, keep your ears open and your mouth shut. It is evil to make mindless offerings to God. [2] Don’t make rash promises, and don’t be hasty in bringing matters before God. After all, God is in heaven, and you are here on earth. So let your words be few.

**Ecclesiastes 5:3 NLT**
[3] Too much activity gives you restless dreams; too many words make you a fool.

**Ecclesiastes 5:4 NLT**
[4] When you make a promise to God, don’t delay in following through, for God takes no pleasure in fools. Keep all the promises you make to him. 

**Ecclesiastes 5:5-6 NLT**
[5] It is better to say nothing than to make a promise and not keep it. [6] Don’t let your mouth make you sin. And don’t defend yourself by telling the Temple messenger that the promise you made was a mistake. That would make God angry, and he might wipe out everything you have achieved.

**Ecclesiastes 5:7 NLT**
[7] Talk is cheap, like daydreams and other useless activities. Fear God instead. 

**Ecclesiastes 5:8-9 NLT**
[8] Don’t be surprised if you see a poor person being oppressed by the powerful and if justice is being miscarried throughout the land. For every official is under orders from higher up, and matters of justice get lost in red tape and bureaucracy. [9] Even the king milks the land for his own profit!

**Ecclesiastes 5:10-11 NLT**
[10] Those who love money will never have enough. How meaningless to think that wealth brings true happiness! [11] The more you have, the more people come to help you spend it. So what good is wealth—except perhaps to watch it slip through your fingers!

**Ecclesiastes 5:12 NLT**
[12] People who work hard sleep well, whether they eat little or much. But the rich seldom get a good night’s sleep.

**Ecclesiastes 5:16-17 NLT**
[16] And this, too, is a very serious problem. People leave this world no better off than when they came. All their hard work is for nothing—like working for the wind. [17] Throughout their lives, they live under a cloud—frustrated, discouraged, and angry.

**Ecclesiastes 5:18-20 NLT**
[18] Even so, I have noticed one thing, at least, that is good. It is good for people to eat, drink, and enjoy their work under the sun during the short life God has given them, and to accept their lot in life. [19] And it is a good thing to receive wealth from God and the good health to enjoy it. To enjoy your work and accept your lot in life—this is indeed a gift from God. [20] God keeps such people so busy enjoying life that they take no time to brood over the past.

### Chapter 6

**Ecclesiastes 6:2 NLT**
[2] God gives some people great wealth and honor and everything they could ever want, but then he doesn’t give them the chance to enjoy these things. They die, and someone else, even a stranger, ends up enjoying their wealth! This is meaningless—a sickening tragedy.

**Ecclesiastes 6:3-5 NLT**
[3] A man might have a hundred children and live to be very old. But if he finds no satisfaction in life and doesn’t even get a decent burial, it would have been better for him to be born dead. [4] His birth would have been meaningless, and he would have ended in darkness. He wouldn’t even have had a name, [5] and he would never have seen the sun or known of its existence. Yet he would have had more peace than in growing up to be an unhappy man. 

**Ecclesiastes 6:8 NLT**
[8] So are wise people really better off than fools? Do poor people gain anything by being wise and knowing how to act in front of others?

**Ecclesiastes 6:9 NLT**
[9] Enjoy what you have rather than desiring what you don’t have. Just dreaming about nice things is meaningless—like chasing the wind. 

### Chapter 7

**Ecclesiastes 7:1 NLT**
[1] A good reputation is more valuable than costly perfume. And the day you die is better than the day you are born.

**Ecclesiastes 7:3 NLT**
[3] Sorrow is better than laughter, for sadness has a refining influence on us.

**Ecclesiastes 7:4 NLT**
[4] A wise person thinks a lot about death, while a fool thinks only about having a good time.

**Ecclesiastes 7:8 NLT**
[8] Finishing is better than starting. Patience is better than pride.

**Ecclesiastes 7:9 NLT**
[9] Control your temper, for anger labels you a fool.

**Ecclesiastes 7:10 NLT**
[10] Don’t long for “the good old days.” This is not wise.

**Ecclesiastes 7:11-12 NLT**
[11] Wisdom is even better when you have money. Both are a benefit as you go through life. [12] Wisdom and money can get you almost anything, but only wisdom can save your life.

**Ecclesiastes 7:14 NLT**
[14] Enjoy prosperity while you can, but when hard times strike, realize that both come from God. Remember that nothing is certain in this life. 

**Ecclesiastes 7:15-18 NLT**
[15] I have seen everything in this meaningless life, including the death of good young people and the long life of wicked people. [16] So don’t be too good or too wise! Why destroy yourself? [17] On the other hand, don’t be too wicked either. Don’t be a fool! Why die before your time? [18] Pay attention to these instructions, for anyone who fears God will avoid both extremes.

**Ecclesiastes 7:20 NLT**
[20] Not a single person on earth is always good and never sins.

**Ecclesiastes 7:21-22 NLT**
[21] Don’t eavesdrop on others—you may hear your servant curse you. [22] For you know how often you yourself have cursed others.

**Ecclesiastes 7:26 NLT**
[26] I discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death. Her passion is a snare, and her soft hands are chains. Those who are pleasing to God will escape her, but sinners will be caught in her snare.

**Ecclesiastes 7:29 NLT**
[29] But I did find this: God created people to be virtuous, but they have each turned to follow their own downward path.”

### Chapter 8

**Ecclesiastes 8:1 NLT**
[1] How wonderful to be wise, to analyze and interpret things. Wisdom lights up a person’s face, softening its harshness. 

**Ecclesiastes 8:6 NLT**
[6] for there is a time and a way for everything, even when a person is in trouble.

**Ecclesiastes 8:10 NLT**
[10] I have seen wicked people buried with honor. Yet they were the very ones who frequented the Temple and are now praised in the same city where they committed their crimes! This, too, is meaningless. 

**Ecclesiastes 8:12 NLT**
[12] But even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time, I know that those who fear God will be better off. 

**Ecclesiastes 8:14 NLT**
[14] And this is not all that is meaningless in our world. In this life, good people are often treated as though they were wicked, and wicked people are often treated as though they were good. This is so meaningless!

**Ecclesiastes 8:15 NLT**
[15] So I recommend having fun, because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat, drink, and enjoy life. That way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work God gives them under the sun.

### Chapter 9

**Ecclesiastes 9:1-2 NLT**
[1] This, too, I carefully explored: Even though the actions of godly and wise people are in God’s hands, no one knows whether God will show them favor. [2] The same destiny ultimately awaits everyone, whether righteous or wicked, good or bad, ceremonially clean or unclean, religious or irreligious. Good people receive the same treatment as sinners, and people who make promises to God are treated like people who don’t.

**Ecclesiastes 9:7-10 NLT**
[7] So go ahead. Eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God approves of this! [8] Wear fine clothes, with a splash of cologne! [9] Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil. [10] Whatever you do, do well. For when you go to the grave, there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.

**Ecclesiastes 9:12 NLT**
[12] People can never predict when hard times might come. Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy. 

**Ecclesiastes 9:16 NLT**
[16] So even though wisdom is better than strength, those who are wise will be despised if they are poor. What they say will not be appreciated for long.

**Ecclesiastes 9:17-18 NLT**
[17] Better to hear the quiet words of a wise person than the shouts of a foolish king. [18] Better to have wisdom than weapons of war, but one sinner can destroy much that is good.

### Chapter 10

**Ecclesiastes 10:2-4 NLT**
[2] A wise person chooses the right road; a fool takes the wrong one. [3] You can identify fools just by the way they walk down the street! [4] If your boss is angry at you, don’t quit! A quiet spirit can overcome even great mistakes. 

**Ecclesiastes 10:5-6 NLT**
[5] There is another evil I have seen under the sun. Kings and rulers make a grave mistake [6] when they give great authority to foolish people and low positions to people of proven worth. 

**Ecclesiastes 10:12-14 NLT**
[12] Wise words bring approval, but fools are destroyed by their own words. [13] Fools base their thoughts on foolish assumptions, so their conclusions will be wicked madness; [14] they chatter on and on. No one really knows what is going to happen; no one can predict the future.

**Ecclesiastes 10:15 NLT**
[15] Fools are so exhausted by a little work that they can’t even find their way home.

**Ecclesiastes 10:17 NLT**
[17] Happy is the land whose king is a noble leader and whose leaders feast at the proper time to gain strength for their work, not to get drunk.

**Ecclesiastes 10:18 NLT**
[18] Laziness leads to a sagging roof; idleness leads to a leaky house.

**Ecclesiastes 10:19 NLT**
[19] A party gives laughter, wine gives happiness, and money gives everything!

**Ecclesiastes 10:20 NLT**
[20] Never make light of the king, even in your thoughts. And don’t make fun of the powerful, even in your own bedroom. For a little bird might deliver your message and tell them what you said.

### Chapter 11

**Ecclesiastes 11:2 NLT**
[2] But divide your investments among many places, for you do not know what risks might lie ahead.

**Ecclesiastes 11:4 NLT**
[4] Farmers who wait for perfect weather never plant. If they watch every cloud, they never harvest.

**Ecclesiastes 11:6 NLT**
[6] Plant your seed in the morning and keep busy all afternoon, for you don’t know if profit will come from one activity or another—or maybe both. 

**Ecclesiastes 11:9 NLT**
[9] Young people, it’s wonderful to be young! Enjoy every minute of it. Do everything you want to do; take it all in. But remember that you must give an account to God for everything you do. 

**Ecclesiastes 11:10 NLT**
[10] So refuse to worry, and keep your body healthy. But remember that youth, with a whole life before you, is meaningless.

### Chapter 12

**Ecclesiastes 12:1 NLT**
[1] Don’t let the excitement of youth cause you to forget your Creator. Honor him in your youth before you grow old and say, “Life is not pleasant anymore.” 

**Ecclesiastes 12:6 NLT**
[6] Yes, remember your Creator now while you are young, before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken. Don’t wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well. 

**Ecclesiastes 12:12 NLT**
[12] But, my child, let me give you some further advice: Be careful, for writing books is endless, and much study wears you out.

**Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 NLT**
[13] That’s the whole story. Here now is my final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone’s duty. [14] God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad.

## Matthew

### Chapter 1

**Matthew 1:19 NLT**
[19] Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement quietly.

### Chapter 3

**Matthew 3:8 NLT**
[8] Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. 

### Chapter 4

**Matthew 4:1-2 NLT**
[1] Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil. [2] For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry.

**Matthew 4:4 NLT**
[4] But Jesus told him, “No! The Scriptures say, ‘People do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ”

### Chapter 5

**Matthew 5:11-12 NLT**
[11]  “God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers. [12] Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way. 

**Matthew 5:13 NLT**
[13]  “You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless.

**Matthew 5:14-16 NLT**
[14]  “You are the light of the world—like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. [15] No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house. [16] In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father. 

**Matthew 5:21-22 NLT**
[21]  “You have heard that our ancestors were told, ‘You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.’ [22] But I say, if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot, you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone, you are in danger of the fires of hell.

**Matthew 5:27-30 NLT**
[27]  “You have heard the commandment that says, ‘You must not commit adultery.’ [28] But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. [29] So if your eye—even your good eye—causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. [30] And if your hand—even your stronger hand—causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 

**Matthew 5:31-32 NLT**
[31]  “You have heard the law that says, ‘A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce.’ [32] But I say that a man who divorces his wife, unless she has been unfaithful, causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery. 

**Matthew 5:33-37 NLT**
[33]  “You have also heard that our ancestors were told, ‘You must not break your vows; you must carry out the vows you make to the Lord.’ [34] But I say, do not make any vows! Do not say, ‘By heaven!’ because heaven is God’s throne. [35] And do not say, ‘By the earth!’ because the earth is his footstool. And do not say, ‘By Jerusalem!’ for Jerusalem is the city of the great King. [36] Do not even say, ‘By my head!’ for you can’t turn one hair white or black. [37] Just say a simple, ‘Yes, I will,’ or ‘No, I won’t.’ Anything beyond this is from the evil one. 

**Matthew 5:38-42 NLT**
[38]  “You have heard the law that says the punishment must match the injury: ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ [39] But I say, do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also. [40] If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you, give your coat, too. [41] If a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile, carry it two miles. [42] Give to those who ask, and don’t turn away from those who want to borrow. 

**Matthew 5:43-45 NLT**
[43]  “You have heard the law that says, ‘Love your neighbor’ and hate your enemy. [44] But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! [45] In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. 

**Matthew 5:46-47 NLT**
[46] If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. [47] If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that. 

### Chapter 6

**Matthew 6:5-6 NLT**
[5]  “When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get. [6] But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.

**Matthew 6:7-8 NLT**
[7]  “When you pray, don’t babble on and on as the Gentiles do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again. [8] Don’t be like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him! 

**Matthew 6:14-15 NLT**
[14]  “If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you. [15] But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.

**Matthew 6:16-18 NLT**
[16]  “And when you fast, don’t make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will ever get. [17] But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face. [18] Then no one will notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows what you do in private. And your Father, who sees everything, will reward you. 

**Matthew 6:19-21 NLT**
[19]  “Don’t store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. [20] Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. [21] Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.

**Matthew 6:22-23 NLT**
[22]  “Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light. [23] But when your eye is unhealthy, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!

**Matthew 6:24 NLT**
[24]  “No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.

**Matthew 6:25 NLT**
[25]  “That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life—whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than food, and your body more than clothing? 

**Matthew 6:27 NLT**
[27] Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?

**Matthew 6:33 NLT**
[33] Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.

**Matthew 6:34 NLT**
[34]  “So don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today’s trouble is enough for today.

### Chapter 7

**Matthew 7:1-2 NLT**
[1]  “Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. [2] For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged.

**Matthew 7:3-5 NLT**
[3]  “And why worry about a speck in your friend’s eye when you have a log in your own? [4] How can you think of saying to your friend, ‘Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,’ when you can’t see past the log in your own eye? [5] Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend’s eye.

**Matthew 7:6 NLT**
[6]  “Don’t waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don’t throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you. 

**Matthew 7:7-8 NLT**
[7]  “Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you. [8] For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.

**Matthew 7:12 NLT**
[12]  “Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets. 

**Matthew 7:13-14 NLT**
[13]  “You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. [14] But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it. 

**Matthew 7:17-20 NLT**
[17] A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit. [18] A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can’t produce good fruit. [19] So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire. [20] Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions. 

**Matthew 7:21-23 NLT**
[21]  “Not everyone who calls out to me, ‘Lord! Lord!’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter. [22] On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’ [23] But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’ 

**Matthew 7:24-27 NLT**
[24]  “Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. [25] Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won’t collapse because it is built on bedrock. [26] But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn’t obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand. [27] When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash.”

### Chapter 8

**Matthew 8:26 NLT**
[26] Jesus responded, “Why are you afraid? You have so little faith!” Then he got up and rebuked the wind and waves, and suddenly there was a great calm.

### Chapter 11

**Matthew 11:28-30 NLT**
[28] Then Jesus said, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. [29] Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls. [30] For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light.”

[9] And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”

**Luke 5:31-32 NKJV**
[31] Jesus answered and said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.  [32] I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” 

### Chapter 6

**Luke 6:37-38 NKJV**
[37] “Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.  [38] Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.”

**Luke 6:46-47 NKJV**
[46] “But why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do the things which I say?  [47] Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like:  

**Luke 6:22-23 NKJV**
[22] Blessed are you when men hate you, And when they exclude you, And revile you, and cast out your name as evil, For the Son of Man’s sake. [23] Rejoice in that day and leap for joy! For indeed your reward is great in heaven, For in like manner their fathers did to the prophets. 

**Luke 6:27-28 NKJV**
[27] “But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,  [28] bless those who curse you, and pray for those who spitefully use you.  

**Luke 6:36 NKJV**
[36] Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful. 

### Chapter 9

**Luke 9:23 NKJV**
[23] Then He said to them all, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.  

**Luke 9:24-25 NKJV**
[24] For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.  [25] For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost?  

### Chapter 11

**Luke 11:9-10 NKJV**
[9] “So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.  [10] For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.  

**Luke 11:28 NKJV**
[28] But He said, “More than that, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!” 

**Luke 11:34-35 NKJV**
[34] The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is good, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is bad, your body also is full of darkness.  [35] Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.  

### Chapter 12

**Luke 12:2-3 NKJV**
[2] For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known.  [3] Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops. 

**Luke 12:9-10 NKJV**
[9] But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God. [10] “And anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.

**Luke 12:11-12 NKJV**
[11] “Now when they bring you to the synagogues and magistrates and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should answer, or what you should say.  [12] For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.” 

**Luke 12:15 NKJV**
[15] And He said to them, “Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.”

**Luke 12:22-23 NKJV**
[22] Then He said to His disciples, “Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about the body, what you will put on.  [23] Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.  

**Luke 12:29-31 NKJV**
[29] “And do not seek what you should eat or what you should drink, nor have an anxious mind.  [30] For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you need these things.  [31] But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.

**Luke 12:34 NKJV**
[34] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 

**Luke 12:40 NKJV**
[40] Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”

**Luke 12:51-53 NKJV**
[51] Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? I tell you, not at all, but rather division.  [52] For from now on five in one house will be divided: three against two, and two against three.  [53] Father will be divided against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.” 

### Chapter 14

**Luke 14:11 NKJV**
[11] For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”

### Chapter 16

**Luke 16:13 NKJV**
[13] “No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.” 

**Luke 16:15 NKJV**
[15] And He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

**Luke 16:10 NLT**
[10]  “If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won’t be honest with greater responsibilities. 

### Chapter 18

**Luke 18:1 NLT**
[1] One day Jesus told his disciples a story to show that they should always pray and never give up. 

**Luke 18:14 NLT**
[14] I tell you, this sinner, not the Pharisee, returned home justified before God. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” 

**Luke 18:27 NLT**
[27] He replied, “What is impossible for people is possible with God.”

**Luke 18:29-30 NLT**
[29]  “Yes,” Jesus replied, “and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the Kingdom of God, [30] will be repaid many times over in this life, and will have eternal life in the world to come.” 

### Chapter 19

**Luke 19:26 NLT**
[26]  “‘Yes,’ the king replied, ‘and to those who use well what they are given, even more will be given. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away. 

### Chapter 20

**Luke 20:46-47 NLT**
[46] “Beware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets. [47] Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, they will be severely punished.”

### Chapter 21

**Luke 21:14-15 NLT**
[14] So don’t worry in advance about how to answer the charges against you, [15] for I will give you the right words and such wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to reply or refute you! 

**Luke 21:16-19 NLT**
[16] Even those closest to you—your parents, brothers, relatives, and friends—will betray you. They will even kill some of you. [17] And everyone will hate you because you are my followers. [18] But not a hair of your head will perish! [19] By standing firm, you will win your souls.

**Luke 21:34-35 NLT**
[34]  “Watch out! Don’t let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness, and by the worries of this life. Don’t let that day catch you unaware, [35] like a trap. For that day will come upon everyone living on the earth. 

**Luke 21:36 NLT**
[36] Keep alert at all times. And pray that you might be strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the Son of Man.”

### Chapter 22

**Luke 22:40 NLT**
[40] There he told them, “Pray that you will not give in to temptation.”

**Luke 22:46 NLT**
[46] “Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation.”

## Acts of the Apostles

### Chapter 2

Acts of the Apostles 2:32-33 NLT
[32] "God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this. [33] Now he is exalted to the place of highest honor in heaven, at God's right hand. And the Father, as he had promised, gave him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us, just as you see and hear today.

Acts of the Apostles 2:38 NLT
[38] Peter replied, "Each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

### Chapter 5

Acts of the Apostles 5:29 NLT
[29] But Peter and the apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than any human authority.

Acts of the Apostles 5:41-42 NLT
[41] The apostles left the high council rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus. [42] And every day, in the Temple and from house to house, they continued to teach and preach this message: "Jesus is the Messiah."

### Chapter 8

Acts of the Apostles 8:16-17 NLT
[16] The Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them, for they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. [17] Then Peter and John laid their hands upon these believers, and they received the Holy Spirit.

### Chapter 16

Acts of the Apostles 16:30-31 NLT 
[30] Then he brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" [31] They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, along with everyone in your household."

## Romans

### Chapter 1

**Romans 1:16-17 NLT**
[16] For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile. [17] This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.” 

**Romans 1:19-20 NLT**
[19] They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them. [20] For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God.

**Romans 1:21-22 NLT**
[21] Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn’t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused. [22] Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools. 

**Romans 1:24-26 NLT**
[24] So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other’s bodies. [25] They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. [26] That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. 

**Romans 1:27-32 NLT**
[27] And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved. [28] Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done. [29] Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. [30] They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents. [31] They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy. [32] They know God’s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.

### Chapter 2

**Romans 2:1 NIV**
[1] You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. 

**Romans 2:13 NIV**
[13] For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 

**Romans 2:27 NIV**
[27] The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.

### Chapter 3

**Romans 3:9-12 NIV**
[9] What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin. [10] As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one; [11] there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. [12] All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”

**Romans 3:19 NIV**
[19] Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. 

**Romans 3:20 NIV**
[20] Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. 

**Romans 3:22-24 NIV**
[22] This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 

**Romans 3:25-31 NIV**
[25] God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— [26] he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. 

### Chapter 4

**Romans 4:14-16 NLT**
[14] If God’s promise is only for those who obey the law, then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless. [15] For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it. (The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break!) [16] So the promise is received by faith. It is given as a free gift. And we are all certain to receive it, whether or not we live according to the law of Moses, if we have faith like Abraham’s. For Abraham is the father of all who believe. 

**Romans 4:24-25 NLT**
[24] for our benefit, too, assuring us that God will also count us as righteous if we believe in him, the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. [25] He was handed over to die because of our sins, and he was raised to life to make us right with God.

### Chapter 5

**Romans 5:1-2 NLT**
[1] Therefore, since we have been made right in God’s sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us. [2] Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God’s glory.

**Romans 5:3-4 NLT**
[3] We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. [4] And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. 

**Romans 5:17 NLT**
[17] For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ.

**Romans 5:21 NLT**
[21] So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God’s wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

### Chapter 6

**Romans 6:1-4 NLT**
[1] Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? [2] Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it? [3] Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death? [4] For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives.

**Romans 6:6-11 NLT**
[6] We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin. [7] For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin. [8] And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him. [9] We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him. [10] When he died, he died once to break the power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God. [11] So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus.

**Romans 6:12-14 NLT**
[12] Do not let sin control the way you live; do not give in to sinful desires. [13] Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin. Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but now you have new life. So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God. [14] Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God’s grace.

**Romans 6:15-18 NLT**
[15] Well then, since God’s grace has set us free from the law, does that mean we can go on sinning? Of course not! [16] Don’t you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living. [17] Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you. 

**Romans 6:19 NLT**
[19] Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this. Previously, you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness, which led ever deeper into sin. Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy.

**Romans 6:20-23 NLT**
[20] When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right. [21] And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom. [22] But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life. 

### Chapter 7

**Romans 7:6 NLT**
[6] But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit. 

**Romans 7:7-12 NLT**
[7] Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin. I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, “You must not covet.” [8] But sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me! If there were no law, sin would not have that power. [9] At one time I lived without understanding the law. But when I learned the command not to covet, for instance, the power of sin came to life, [10] and I died. So I discovered that the law’s commands, which were supposed to bring life, brought spiritual death instead. [11] Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me. [12] But still, the law itself is holy, and its commands are holy and right and good.

**Romans 7:13 NLT**
[13] But how can that be? Did the law, which is good, cause my death? Of course not! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death. So we can see how terrible sin really is. It uses God’s good commands for its own evil purposes. 

**Romans 7:18-20 NLT**
[18] And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. I want to do what is right, but I can’t. [19] I want to do what is good, but I don’t. I don’t want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway. [20] But if I do what I don’t want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.

**Romans 7:21-25 NLT**
[21] I have discovered this principle of life—that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong. [22] I love God’s law with all my heart. [23] But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me. [24] Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death? [25] Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God’s law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin.

### Chapter 8

**Romans 8:1-4 NLT**
[1] So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus. [2] And because you belong to him, the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death. [3] The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature. So God did what the law could not do. He sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have. And in that body God declared an end to sin’s control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins. [4] He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.

**Romans 8:5 NLT**
[5] Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit. 

**Romans 8:6-8 NLT**
[6] So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace. [7] For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God’s laws, and it never will. [8] That’s why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.

**Romans 8:9-11 NLT**
[9] But you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.) [10] And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God. [11] The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by this same Spirit living within you.

**Romans 8:12-14 NLT**
[12] Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, you have no obligation to do what your sinful nature urges you to do. [13] For if you live by its dictates, you will die. But if through the power of the Spirit you put to death the deeds of your sinful nature, you will live. [14] For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.

**Romans 8:15-17 NLT**
[15] So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God’s Spirit when he adopted you as his own children. Now we call him, “Abba, Father.” [16] For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God’s children. [17] And since we are his children, we are his heirs. In fact, together with Christ we are heirs of God’s glory. But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering. 

**Romans 8:23-24 NLT**
[23] And we believers also groan, even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory, for we long for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering. We, too, wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children, including the new bodies he has promised us. [24] We were given this hope when we were saved. (If we already have something, we don’t need to hope for it. 

**Romans 8:25 NLT**
[25] But if we look forward to something we don’t yet have, we must wait patiently and confidently.)

**Romans 8:26 NLT**
[26] And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don’t know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words. 

**Romans 8:28-29 NLT**
[28] And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. [29] For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. 

**Romans 8:31 NLT**
[31] What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us? 

**Romans 8:32-34 NLT**
[32] Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won’t he also give us everything else? [33] Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No one—for God himself has given us right standing with himself. [34] Who then will condemn us? No one—for Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honor at God’s right hand, pleading for us.

**Romans 8:35-37 NLT**
[35] Can anything ever separate us from Christ’s love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? [36] (As the Scriptures say, “For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.”) [37] No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.

**Romans 8:38-39 NLT**
[38] And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. [39] No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.

### Chapter 9

**Romans 9:14-16 NLT**
[14] Are we saying, then, that God was unfair? Of course not! [15] For God said to Moses, “I will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose.” [16] So it is God who decides to show mercy. We can neither choose it nor work for it.

**Romans 9:18 NLT**
[18] So you see, God chooses to show mercy to some, and he chooses to harden the hearts of others so they refuse to listen.

**Romans 9:22-24 NLT**
[22] In the same way, even though God has the right to show his anger and his power, he is very patient with those on whom his anger falls, who are destined for destruction. [23] He does this to make the riches of his glory shine even brighter on those to whom he shows mercy, who were prepared in advance for glory. [24] And we are among those whom he selected, both from the Jews and from the Gentiles.

**Romans 9:28 NLT**
[28] For the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth quickly and with finality.”

**Romans 9:30-32 NLT**
[30] What does all this mean? Even though the Gentiles were not trying to follow God’s standards, they were made right with God. And it was by faith that this took place. [31] But the people of Israel, who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law, never succeeded. [32] Why not? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law instead of by trusting in him. They stumbled over the great rock in their path. 

### Chapter 10

**Romans 10:2-3 NLT**
[2] I know what enthusiasm they have for God, but it is misdirected zeal. [3] For they don’t understand God’s way of making people right with himself. Refusing to accept God’s way, they cling to their own way of getting right with God by trying to keep the law. 

**Romans 10:4 NLT**
[4] For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given. As a result, all who believe in him are made right with God. 

**Romans 10:5 NLT**
[5] For Moses writes that the law’s way of making a person right with God requires obedience to all of its commands. 

**Romans 10:6-8 NLT**
[6] But faith’s way of getting right with God says, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will go up to heaven?’ (to bring Christ down to earth). [7] And don’t say, ‘Who will go down to the place of the dead?’ (to bring Christ back to life again).” [8] In fact, it says, “The message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart.” And that message is the very message about faith that we preach: 

**Romans 10:9-10 NLT**
[9] If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. [10] For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. 

**Romans 10:11-13 NLT**
[11] As the Scriptures tell us, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.” [12] Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect. They have the same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him. [13] For “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”

**Romans 10:14-15 NLT**
[14] But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? [15] And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, “How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!”

**Romans 10:16-17 NLT**
[16] But not everyone welcomes the Good News, for Isaiah the prophet said, “Lord, who has believed our message?” [17] So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ.

### Chapter 11

**Romans 11:6 NLT**
[6] And since it is through God’s kindness, then it is not by their good works. For in that case, God’s grace would not be what it really is—free and undeserved.

**Romans 11:17-18 NLT**
[17] But some of these branches from Abraham’s tree—some of the people of Israel—have been broken off. And you Gentiles, who were branches from a wild olive tree, have been grafted in. So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children, sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God’s special olive tree. [18] But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the branches that were broken off. You are just a branch, not the root.

**Romans 11:23 NLT**
[23] And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, for God has the power to graft them back into the tree. 

**Romans 11:29 NLT**
[29] For God’s gifts and his call can never be withdrawn. 

**Romans 11:32 NLT**
[32] For God has imprisoned everyone in disobedience so he could have mercy on everyone.

**Romans 11:33-35 NLT**
[33] Oh, how great are God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How impossible it is for us to understand his decisions and his ways! [34] For who can know the Lord’s thoughts? Who knows enough to give him advice? [35] And who has given him so much that he needs to pay it back?

**Romans 11:36 NLT**
[36] For everything comes from Him and exists by His power and is intended for His glory. All glory to Him forever! Amen.

### Chapter 12

**Romans 12:1-2 NLT**
[1] And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him. [2] Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.

**Romans 12:3 NLT**
[3] Because of the privilege and authority God has given me, I give each of you this warning: Don’t think you are better than you really are. Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us. 

**Romans 12:4-5 NLT**
[4] Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function, [5] so it is with Christ’s body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other.

**Romans 12:6-8 NLT**
[6] In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you. [7] If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well. [8] If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly.

**Romans 12:9 NLT**
[9] Don’t just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good. 

**Romans 12:10 NLT**
[10] Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other. 

**Romans 12:11 NLT**
[11] Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically. 

**Romans 12:12 NLT**
[12] Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying. 

**Romans 12:13 NLT**
[13] When God’s people are in need, be ready to help them. Always be eager to practice hospitality.

**Romans 12:14 NLT**
[14] Bless those who persecute you. Don’t curse them; pray that God will bless them. 

**Romans 12:15 NLT**
[15] Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. 

**Romans 12:16 NLT**
[16] Live in harmony with each other. Don’t be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don’t think you know it all!

**Romans 12:17-18 NLT**
[17] Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable. [18] Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.

**Romans 12:19-21 NLT**
[19] Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, “I will take revenge; I will pay them back,” says the Lord. [20] Instead, “If your enemies are hungry, feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads.” [21] Don’t let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.

### Chapter 13

**Romans 13:1-3 NLT**
[1] Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. [2] So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished. [3] For the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right, but in those who are doing wrong. Would you like to live without fear of the authorities? Do what is right, and they will honor you. 

**Romans 13:4-5 NLT**
[4] The authorities are God’s servants, sent for your good. But if you are doing wrong, of course you should be afraid, for they have the power to punish you. They are God’s servants, sent for the very purpose of punishing those who do what is wrong. [5] So you must submit to them, not only to avoid punishment, but also to keep a clear conscience.

**Romans 13:6-7 NLT**
[6] Pay your taxes, too, for these same reasons. For government workers need to be paid. They are serving God in what they do. [7] Give to everyone what you owe them: Pay your taxes and government fees to those who collect them, and give respect and honor to those who are in authority. 

**Romans 13:8 NLT**
[8] Owe nothing to anyone—except for your obligation to love one another. If you love your neighbor, you will fulfill the requirements of God’s law. 

**Romans 13:9 NLT**
[9] For the commandments say, “You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not covet.” These—and other such commandments—are summed up in this one commandment: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” 

**Romans 13:10 NLT**
[10] Love does no wrong to others, so love fulfills the requirements of God’s law.

**Romans 13:11-14 NLT**
[11] This is all the more urgent, for you know how late it is; time is running out. Wake up, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. [12] The night is almost gone; the day of salvation will soon be here. So remove your dark deeds like dirty clothes, and put on the shining armor of right living. [13] Because we belong to the day, we must live decent lives for all to see. Don’t participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness, or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living, or in quarreling and jealousy. [14] Instead, clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don’t let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires.

### Chapter 14

**Romans 14:1 NLT**
[1] Accept other believers who are weak in faith, and don’t argue with them about what they think is right or wrong. 

**Romans 14:2-4 NLT**
[2] For instance, one person believes it’s all right to eat anything. But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables. [3] Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don’t. And those who don’t eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them. [4] Who are you to condemn someone else’s servants? Their own master will judge whether they stand or fall. And with the Lord’s help, they will stand and receive his approval.

**Romans 14:5-6 NLT**
[5] In the same way, some think one day is more holy than another day, while others think every day is alike. You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable. [6] Those who worship the Lord on a special day do it to honor him. Those who eat any kind of food do so to honor the Lord, since they give thanks to God before eating. And those who refuse to eat certain foods also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God. 

**Romans 14:7-9 NLT**
[7] For we don’t live for ourselves or die for ourselves. [8] If we live, it’s to honor the Lord. And if we die, it’s to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. [9] Christ died and rose again for this very purpose—to be Lord both of the living and of the dead.

**Romans 14:10 NLT**
[10] So why do you condemn another believer? Why do you look down on another believer? Remember, we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. 

**Romans 14:11 NLT**
[11] For the Scriptures say, “‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will declare allegiance to God.’”

**Romans 14:12-13 NLT**
[12] Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God. [13] So let’s stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall.

**Romans 14:14-16 NLT**
[14] I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat. But if someone believes it is wrong, then for that person it is wrong. [15] And if another believer is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don’t let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died. [16] Then you will not be criticized for doing something you believe is good. 

**Romans 14:17-18 NLT**
[17] For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. [18] If you serve Christ with this attitude, you will please God, and others will approve of you, too. 

**Romans 14:19 NLT**
[19] So then, let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up.

**Romans 14:20-21 NLT**
[20] Don’t tear apart the work of God over what you eat. Remember, all foods are acceptable, but it is wrong to eat something if it makes another person stumble. [21] It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble. 

**Romans 14:22 NLT**
[22] You may believe there’s nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who don’t feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right. 

**Romans 14:23 NLT**
[23] But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.

### Chapter 15

**Romans 15:1-3 NLT**
[1] We who are strong must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things like this. We must not just please ourselves. [2] We should help others do what is right and build them up in the Lord. [3] For even Christ didn’t live to please himself. As the Scriptures say, “The insults of those who insult you, O God, have fallen on me.” 

**Romans 15:4 NLT**
[4] Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God’s promises to be fulfilled.

**Romans 15:5 NLT**
[5] May God, who gives this patience and encouragement, help you live in complete harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus. 

**Romans 15:7 NLT**
[7] Therefore, accept each other just as Christ has accepted you so that God will be given glory. 

**Romans 15:13 NLT**
[13] I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit. 

**Romans 15:20 NLT**
[20] My ambition has always been to preach the Good News where the name of Christ has never been heard, rather than where a church has already been started by someone else. 

### Chapter 16

**Romans 16:17-18 NLT**
[17] And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people’s faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them. [18] Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people. 

**Romans 16:19 NLT**
[19] But everyone knows that you are obedient to the Lord. This makes me very happy. I want you to be wise in doing right and to stay innocent of any wrong. 

**Romans 16:27 NLT**
[27] All glory to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, forever. Amen.

## 1 Corinthians

### Chapter 1

**1 Corinthians 1:8 ERV**
[8] He will keep you strong until the end so that on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ comes, you will be free from all blame. 

**1 Corinthians 1:10 ERV**
[10] Brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, I beg all of you to agree with each other. You should not be divided into different groups. Be completely joined together again with the same kind of thinking and the same purpose.

**1 Corinthians 1:13 ERV**
[13] Christ cannot be divided into different groups. It wasn’t Paul who died on the cross for you, was it? Were you baptized in Paul’s name? 

**1 Corinthians 1:18-19 ERV**
[18] The teaching about the cross seems foolish to those who are lost. But to us who are being saved it is the power of God. [19] As the Scriptures say, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise. I will confuse the understanding of the intelligent.” Isaiah 29:14

**1 Corinthians 1:23-25 ERV**
[23] But this is the message we tell everyone: Christ was killed on a cross. This message is a problem for Jews, and to other people it is nonsense. [24] But Christ is God’s power and wisdom to the people God has chosen, both Jews and Greeks. [25] Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom. Even the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.

**1 Corinthians 1:26 ERV**
[26] Brothers and sisters, God chose you to be his. Think about that! Not many of you were wise in the way the world judges wisdom. Not many of you had great influence, and not many of you came from important families. 

**1 Corinthians 1:27 ERV**
[27] But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. He chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 

**1 Corinthians 1:28-29 ERV**
[28] And God chose what the world thinks is not important—what the world hates and thinks is nothing. He chose these to destroy what the world thinks is important. [29] God did this so that no one can stand before him and boast about anything. 

**1 Corinthians 1:30 ERV**
[30] It is God who has made you part of Christ Jesus. And Christ has become for us wisdom from God. He is the reason we are right with God and pure enough to be in his presence. Christ is the one who set us free from sin. 

**1 Corinthians 1:31 ERV**
[31] So, as the Scriptures say, “Whoever boasts should boast only about the Lord.”


### Chapter 2

**1 Corinthians 2:1, 4-5 ERV**
[1] Dear brothers and sisters, when I came to you, I told you the secret truth of God. But I did not use fancy words or great wisdom. 
[4] My teaching and my speaking were not with wise words that persuade people. But the proof of my teaching was the power that the Spirit gives. [5] I did this so that your faith would be in God’s power, not in human wisdom. 


### Chapter 4

**1 Corinthians 4:4-5 ERV**
[4] I don’t know of any wrong I have done, but that does not make me right. The Lord is the one who must decide if I have done well or not. [5] So don’t judge anyone now. The time for judging will be when the Lord comes. He will shine light on everything that is now hidden in darkness. He will make known the secret purposes of our hearts. Then the praise each person should get will come from God.

**1 Corinthians 4:7 ERV**
[7] Who do you think you are? Everything you have was given to you. So, if everything you have was given to you, why do you act as if you got it all by your own power?

**1 Corinthians 4:8 ERV**
[8] You think you have everything you need. You think you are rich. You think you have become kings without us. I wish you really were kings. Then we could rule together with you. 

**1 Corinthians 4:9 ERV**
[9] But it seems to me that God has given me and the other apostles the last place. We are like prisoners condemned to die, led in a parade for the whole world to see—not just people but angels too. 

**1 Corinthians 4:10-11 ERV**
[10] We are fools for Christ, but you think you are so wise in Christ. We are weak, but you think you are so strong. People give you honor, but they don’t honor us. [11] Even now we still don’t have enough to eat or drink, and we don’t have enough clothes. We often get beatings. We have no homes. 

**1 Corinthians 4:12 ERV**
[12] We work hard with our own hands to feed ourselves. When people insult us, we ask God to bless them. When people treat us badly, we accept it. 

**1 Corinthians 4:13 ERV**
[13] When people say bad things about us, we try to say something that will help them. But people still treat us like the world’s garbage—everyone’s trash.


### Chapter 5

**1 Corinthians 5:11 ERV**
[11] I meant you must not associate with people who claim to be believers but continue to live in sin. Don’t even eat with a brother or sister who sins sexually, is greedy, worships idols, abuses others with insults, gets drunk, or cheats people.


### Chapter 6

**1 Corinthians 6:2-3 ERV**
[2] Don’t you know that God’s people will judge the world? So if you will judge the world, then surely you can judge small arguments like this. [3] You know that in the future we will judge angels. So surely we can judge life’s ordinary problems. 

**1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ERV**
[9-10] Surely you know that people who do wrong will not get to enjoy God’s kingdom. Don’t be fooled. These are the people who will not get to enjoy his kingdom: those who sin sexually, those who worship idols, those who commit adultery, men who let other men use them for sex or who have sex with other men, those who steal, those who are greedy, those who drink too much, those who abuse others with insults, and those who cheat. 

**1 Corinthians 6:11 ERV**
[11] In the past some of you were like that. But you were washed clean, you were made holy, and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. 

**1 Corinthians 6:12 ERV**
[12] “I am allowed to do anything,” you say. My answer to this is that not all things are good. Even if it is true that “I am allowed to do anything,” I will not let anything control me like a slave. 

**1 Corinthians 6:13-15 ERV**
[13] Someone else says, “Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food.” Yes, and God will destroy them both. But the body is not for sexual sin. The body is for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. [14] And God will raise our bodies from death with the same power he used to raise the Lord Jesus. [15] Surely you know that your bodies are parts of Christ himself. So I must never take what is part of Christ and join it to a prostitute! 

**1 Corinthians 6:18-20 ERV**
[18] So run away from sexual sin. It involves the body in a way that no other sin does. So if you commit sexual sin, you are sinning against your own body. [19] You should know that your body is a temple for the Holy Spirit that you received from God and that lives in you. You don’t own yourselves. [20] God paid a very high price to make you his. So honor God with your body.


### Chapter 7

**1 Corinthians 7:1-2 ERV**
[1] Now I will discuss the things you wrote me about. You asked if it is better for a man not to have any sexual relations at all. [2] But sexual sin is a danger, so each man should enjoy his own wife, and each woman should enjoy her own husband. 

**1 Corinthians 7:3 ERV**
[3] The husband should give his wife what she deserves as his wife. And the wife should give her husband what he deserves as her husband. 

**1 Corinthians 7:5 ERV**
[5] Don’t refuse to give your bodies to each other. But you might both agree to stay away from sex for a while so that you can give your time to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not be able to tempt you in your weakness. 

**1 Corinthians 7:9 ERV**
[9] But if you cannot control your body, then you should marry. It is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.

**1 Corinthians 7:10-11 ERV**
[10] Now, I have a command for those who are married. Actually, it is not from me; it is what the Lord commanded. A wife should not leave her husband. [11] But if a wife does leave, she should remain single or get back together with her husband. And a husband should not divorce his wife.

**1 Corinthians 7:17 ERV**
[17] But each one of you should continue to live the way the Lord God has given you to live—the way you were when God chose you. I tell people in all the churches to follow this rule. 

**1 Corinthians 7:20-22 ERV**
[20] Each one of you should stay the way you were when God chose you. [21] If you were a slave when God chose you, don’t let that bother you. But if you can be free, then do it. [22] If you were a slave when the Lord chose you, you are now free in the Lord. You belong to the Lord. In the same way, if you were free when you were chosen, you are now Christ’s slave. 

**1 Corinthians 7:23 ERV**
[23] God paid a high price for you, so don’t be slaves to anyone else. 

**1 Corinthians 7:27 ERV**
[27] If you have a wife, don’t try to get free from her. If you are not married, don’t try to find a wife. 

**1 Corinthians 7:28 ERV**
[28] But if you decide to marry, that is not a sin. And it is not a sin for a girl who has never married to get married. But those who marry will have trouble in this life, and I want you to be free from this trouble.

**1 Corinthians 7:30 ERV**
[30] It should not be important whether you are sad or whether you are happy. If you buy something, it should not matter to you that you own it. 

**1 Corinthians 7:31 ERV**
[31] You should use the things of the world without letting them become important to you. This is how you should live, because this world, the way it is now, will soon be gone.

**1 Corinthians 7:32-35 ERV**
[32] I want you to be free from worry. A man who is not married is busy with the Lord’s work. He is trying to please the Lord. [33] But a man who is married is busy with things of the world. He is trying to please his wife. [34] He must think about two things—pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord. A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord’s work. She wants to give herself fully—body and spirit—to the Lord. But a married woman is busy with things of the world. She is trying to please her husband. [35] I am saying this to help you. I am not trying to limit you, but I want you to live in the right way. And I want you to give yourselves fully to the Lord without giving your time to other things.

**1 Corinthians 7:39-40 ERV**
[39] A woman should stay with her husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, the woman is free to marry any man she wants, but he should belong to the Lord. [40] The woman is happier if she does not marry again. This is my opinion, and I believe that I have God’s Spirit.


====

**1 Corinthians 8:1-2 ERV**
[1] Now I will write about meat that is sacrificed to idols. It is certainly true that “we all have knowledge,” as you say. But this knowledge only fills people with pride. It is love that helps the church grow stronger. [2] Those who think they know something do not yet know anything as they should. 

**1 Corinthians 8:3 ERV**
[3] But whoever loves God is known by God.

**1 Corinthians 8:4, 7-8 ERV**
[4] So this is what I say about eating meat: We know that an idol is really nothing in the world, and we know that there is only one God. 
[7] But not all people know this. Some have had the habit of worshiping idols. So now when they eat meat, they still feel as if it belongs to an idol. They are not sure that it is right to eat this meat. So when they eat it, they feel guilty. [8] But food will not bring us closer to God. Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God, and eating does not make us closer to him.


### Chapter 9  

**1 Corinthians 9:16-18 ERV**
[16] It’s not my work of telling the Good News that gives me any reason to boast. That is my duty—something I must do. If I don’t tell people the Good News, I am in real trouble. [17] If I did it because it was my own choice, I would deserve to be paid. But I have no choice. I must tell the Good News. So I am only doing the duty that was given to me. [18] So what do I get for doing it? My reward is that when I tell people the Good News I can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work.

**1 Corinthians 9:19 ERV**
[19] I am free. I belong to no other person, but I make myself a slave to everyone. I do this to help save as many people as I can. 

**1 Corinthians 9:24, 27 ERV**
[24] You know that in a race all the runners run, but only one runner gets the prize. So run like that. Run to win! 
[27] It is my own body I fight to make it do what I want. I do this so that I won’t miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it.

  
### Chapter 10

**1 Corinthians 10:2-5 ERV**
[2] They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. [3] They all ate the same spiritual food, [4] and they all drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from that spiritual rock that was with them, and that rock was Christ. [5] But God was not pleased with most of those people, so they were killed in the desert.

**1 Corinthians 10:7-10 ERV**
[7] Don’t worship idols as some of them did. As the Scriptures say, “The people sat down to eat and drink and then got up to have a wild party.” [8] We should not commit sexual sins as some of them did. In one day 23,000 of them died because of their sin. [9] We should not test Christ as some of them did. Because of that, they were killed by snakes. [10] And don’t complain as some of them did. Because they complained, they were killed by the angel that destroys.

**1 Corinthians 10:11 ERV**
[11] The things that happened to those people are examples. They were written to be warnings for us. We live in the time that all those past histories were pointing to. 

**1 Corinthians 10:12 ERV**
[12] So anyone who thinks they are standing strong should be careful that they don’t fall. 

**1 Corinthians 10:13 ERV**
[13] The only temptations that you have are the same temptations that all people have. But you can trust God. He will not let you be tempted more than you can bear. But when you are tempted, God will also give you a way to escape that temptation. Then you will be able to endure it.

**1 Corinthians 10:23-24 ERV**
[23] “All things are allowed,” you say. But not all things are good. “All things are allowed.” But some things don’t help anyone. [24] Try to do what is good for others, not just what is good for yourselves.

**1 Corinthians 10:31 ERV**
[31] So if you eat, or if you drink, or if you do anything, do it for the glory of God. 

**1 Corinthians 10:33 ERV**
[33] I do the same thing. I try to please everyone in every way. I am not trying to do what is good for me. I am trying to do what is good for the most people so that they can be saved.

  
### Chapter 11

**1 Corinthians 11:1-3 ERV**
[1] Follow my example, just as I follow the example of Christ.  [2] I praise you because you remember me in all things. You follow closely the teachings I gave you. [3] But I want you to understand this: The head of every man is Christ. And the head of a woman is the man. And the head of Christ is God.

**1 Corinthians 11:7-8 ERV**
[7] But a man should not cover his head, because he is made like God and is God’s glory. But woman is man’s glory. [8] Man did not come from woman. Woman came from man. 

**1 Corinthians 11:9 ERV**
[9] And man was not made for woman. Woman was made for man. 

**1 Corinthians 11:11-12 ERV**
[11] But in the Lord the woman needs the man, and the man needs the woman. [12] This is true because woman came from man, but also man is born from woman. Really, everything comes from God.

**1 Corinthians 11:27-28 ERV**
[27] So if you eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in a way that does not fit its meaning, you are sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord. [28] Before you eat the bread and drink the cup, you should examine your own attitude. 

**1 Corinthians 11:32 ERV**
[32] But when the Lord judges us, he punishes us to show us the right way. He does this so that we will not be condemned with the world.

**1 Corinthians 11:33 ERV**
[33] So, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. 


### Chapter 12

**1 Corinthians 12:2 ERV**
[2] You remember the lives you lived before you were believers. You let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols—things that have no life. 

**1 Corinthians 12:4-6 ERV**
[4] There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but they are all from the same Spirit. [5] There are different ways to serve, but we serve the same Lord. [6] And there are different ways that God works in people, but it is the same God who works in all of us to do everything.

**1 Corinthians 12:8-11 ERV**
[8] The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom. And the same Spirit gives another person the ability to speak with knowledge. [9] The same Spirit gives faith to one person and to another he gives gifts of healing. [10] The Spirit gives to one person the power to do miracles, to another the ability to prophesy, and to another the ability to judge what is from the Spirit and what is not. The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak in different kinds of languages, and to another the ability to interpret those languages. [11] One Spirit, the same Spirit, does all these things. The Spirit decides what to give each one. 

**1 Corinthians 12:12-13 ERV**
[12] A person has only one body, but it has many parts. Yes, there are many parts, but all those parts are still just one body. Christ is like that too. [13] Some of us are Jews and some of us are not; some of us are slaves and some of us are free. But we were all baptized to become one body through one Spirit. And we were all given the one Spirit.

**1 Corinthians 12:15 ERV**
[15] The foot might say, “I am not a hand, so I don’t belong to the body.” But saying this would not stop the foot from being a part of the body. 

**1 Corinthians 12:17-20 ERV**
[17] If the whole body were an eye, it would not be able to hear. If the whole body were an ear, it would not be able to smell anything. [18-19] If each part of the body were the same part, there would be no body. But as it is, God put the parts in the body as he wanted them. He made a place for each one. [20] So there are many parts, but only one body.

**1 Corinthians 12:21-24 ERV**
[21] The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the foot, “I don’t need you!” [22] No, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are actually very important. [23] And the parts that we think are not worth very much are the parts we give the most care to. And we give special care to the parts of the body that we don’t want to show. [24] The more beautiful parts don’t need this special care. But God put the body together and gave more honor to the parts that need it. 

**1 Corinthians 12:25 ERV**
[25] God did this so that our body would not be divided. God wanted the different parts to care the same for each other. 

**1 Corinthians 12:26 ERV**
[26] If one part of the body suffers, then all the other parts suffer with it. Or if one part is honored, then all the other parts share its honor.

**1 Corinthians 12:31 ERV**
[31] Continue to give your attention to the spiritual gifts you consider to be the greatest. But now I want to point out a way of life that is even greater.


### Chapter 13

**1 Corinthians 13:1 ERV**
[1] I may speak in different languages, whether human or even of angels. But if I don’t have love, I am only a noisy bell or a ringing cymbal. 

**1 Corinthians 13:2 ERV**
[2] I may have the gift of prophecy, I may understand all secrets and know everything there is to know, and I may have faith so great that I can move mountains. But even with all this, if I don’t have love, I am nothing. 

**1 Corinthians 13:3 ERV**
[3] I may give away everything I have to help others, and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned. But I gain nothing by doing all this if I don’t have love.

**1 Corinthians 13:4-7 ERV**
[4] Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud. [5] Love is not rude, it is not selfish, and it cannot be made angry easily. Love does not remember wrongs done against it. [6] Love is never happy when others do wrong, but it is always happy with the truth. [7] Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.

**1 Corinthians 13:11-12 ERV**
[11] When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, and I made plans like a child. When I became a man, I stopped those childish ways. [12] It is the same with us. Now we see God as if we are looking at a reflection in a mirror. But then, in the future, we will see him right before our eyes. Now I know only a part, but at that time I will know fully, as God has known me. 

**1 Corinthians 13:13 ERV**
[13] So these three things continue: faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love.

  
### Chapter 14

**1 Corinthians 14:1, 3 ERV**
[1] Love should be the goal of your life, but you should also want to have the gifts that come from the Spirit. And the gift you should want most is to be able to prophesy. 
[3] But those who prophesy are speaking to people. They help people grow stronger in faith, and they give encouragement and comfort. 

**1 Corinthians 14:9 ERV**
[9] It is the same with you. If you don’t speak clearly in a language people know, they cannot understand what you are saying. You will be talking to the air! 

**1 Corinthians 14:22 ERV**
[22] And from this we see that the use of different languages shows how God deals with those who don’t believe, not with those who believe. And prophecy shows how God works through those who believe, not through unbelievers. 

**1 Corinthians 14:25 ERV**
[25] The secret things in their heart will be made known. So they will bow down and worship God. They will say, “Without a doubt, God is here with you.” 

**1 Corinthians 14:34-35 ERV**
[34] The women should keep quiet in these church meetings. They are not allowed to speak out but should be under authority, as the Law of Moses says. [35] If there is something they want to know, they should ask their own husbands at home. It is shameful for a woman to speak up like that in the church meeting.

**1 Corinthians 14:40 ERV**
[40] But everything should be done in a way that is right and orderly.

## Philippians

### Chapter 1

**Philippians 1:3-4**
[3-4] I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy

**Philippians 1:7**
[7] It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God’s grace with me.

**Philippians 1:9-11**
[9-11] And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.

**Philippians 1:18**
[18] But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,

**Philippians 1:27-28**
[27-28] Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God.

**Philippians 1:29-30**
[29-30] For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.

## James

### Chapter 1

**James 1:2-3 NKJV**
[2] My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, [3] knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. 

**James 1:5 NKJV**
[5] If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. 

**James 1:22-25 NKJV**
[22] But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. [23] For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; [24] for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. [25] But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.

### Chapter 2

**James 2:26 NKJV**
[26] For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

### Chapter 3

**James 3:1-2 NKJV**
[1] My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment. [2] For we all stumble in many things. 

**James 3:17-18 NKJV**
[17] But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. [18] Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

### Chapter 5

**James 5:9 NKJV**
[9] Do not grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door! 

**James 5:12 NKJV**
[12] But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your “Yes” be “Yes,” and your “No,” “No,” lest you fall into judgment. 

**James 5:19-20 NKJV**
[19] Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back, [20] let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.
