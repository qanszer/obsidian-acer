# Personal Gospel Sharing Method


# My Answer From Discipleship Exam

God exists. He loves you and wants to have a personal relationship with you.

But sin separates us from God. Every person has sinned due to their own sinful nature. Sin ultimately leads to eternal separation from Him, which is eternal death.

For God so loved the world(us) that He gave His only begotten Son(Jesus Christ), and crucified Him on the cross to pay the penalty of our sins. Jesus Christ is God's way of connecting us with Him. That whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.

This means that if you believe wholeheartedly, and accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, you will be saved.

Are you willing to accept Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior?
