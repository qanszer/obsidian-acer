## How to Use These:

- **Mix categories** throughout your date so it doesn't feel monotonous
- **Start light** (fun/random), move to **deeper ones** as you get comfortable
- **Explain your answers** - the "why" is more interesting than the choice
- **No judgment** - some answers might surprise you!
- **Follow-up questions** - dig deeper into interesting responses
