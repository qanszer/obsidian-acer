# Live For Your Father's Pleasure
**1 Peter 4:1-11**
December 28, 2025

### 01 - Read about God

Reading about God is how one can live according the His will

Read the Bible. Do it with a mindset to know the author---God.

Josh McDowell - "Evidence That Demands A Verdict"
This is a book that tries to answer questions about the Bible

**1 Peter 2:1-3**
So get rid of all evil behavior. Be done with all deceit, hypocrisy, jealousy, and all unkind speech. 2 Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you will grow into a full experience of salvation. Cry out for this nourishment, 3 now that you have had a taste of the Lord’s kindness.

> "Conversion without formation is fragility"

All the bible verses you've learned will be for nothing if you will not apply it.


**1 Peter 3:18**
The purpose of Jesus' suffering is to bring us to God


### 02 - Share about God

God will do His part. We should do our own as well, which is to share His Word.

**1 Peter 2:15-16 - Share God through your way of living**

15 It is God’s will that your honorable lives should silence those ignorant people who make foolish accusations against you. 16 For you are free, yet you are God’s slaves, so don’t use your freedom as an excuse to do evil.

**3 Responses to Sharing the Gospel:**

1. Fight
2. Flight
3. Fright


**How Can You Share God?**

> Heed God's calling to share the Gospel whenever and wherever you are

> God has made it a rule for himself that He wont alter people's character by force. He can and will alter them, but only if the people will let Him.  -- CS Lewis

'The Gospel Train' is a 2min 30sec secular song that spread the Gospel far and wide. The artist used this as his platform to share God's Word to people.

Michael Philips, the MVP of this UAAP season from De La Salle, used basketball as his platform to share God.

What about you? What's your platform to share God?


### 03 - Live for God

> Before I do something, will my master, the Lord, be pleased?

A prime example of someone living for God is **George Foreman**'s life story.

The bible is composed of 31,102 verses. 

**1 Peter 4:7-9**
7 The end of the world is coming soon. Therefore, be earnest and disciplined in your prayers. 8 Most important of all, continue to show deep love for each other, for love covers a multitude of sins. 9 Cheerfully share your home with those who need a meal or a place to stay.
