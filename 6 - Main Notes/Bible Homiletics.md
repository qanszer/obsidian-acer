## 02 - Basic Structure

### INTAC - Introduction, Need, Text, Application, Challenge

### A. Introduction

*"Why will I listen to you?"*

The first few minutes are very crucial.

People may not pay attention to what you will say in the middle if they won't be hooked in the first place.

**Purpose:** Engage, connect, and establish
**Suggestions:** Ask a question, share a personal experience, or tell a funny story
**Objective:** They should think, "I want to listen to this"


### B. Need

*"Why do I need to listen to you?"*

**Suggestions:**
1. Know their struggles related to the topic
2. Paint the picture why they can't stay where they are
3. Cast the vision on where they could be

**Objective:** They should think, "I need to listen to this"


### C. Text

*"What is God saying to me?"*

A devotion must be simple and deep. At the same time, the objective should be conviction and conversion.


### D. Application

*"How should I apply this in my life?"*

**Guidelines:** Relevant, attainable, and specific
**Objective:** They should think, "I know exactly what I should do"


### E. Challenge

*"Why should I do this now?*

The ending should tug their very being to make them inspired to act.

**Suggestions:**
1. A real story
2. A personal experience
3. An object lesson

## 03 - Additional Tools

1. **Illustrate** - make something clearer through vivid examples, pictures, video, etc
2. **Contrast** - tell a striking difference to better emphasize a point
3. **Question** - help someone process it themselves rather than just being told directly
