# Discipline is not about waking up at 5 AM. It’s about this brutal truth nobody wants to face.


People hype discipline like it’s all about waking up at 5 AM, cold showers, grinding like a robot. Tbh, that’s not real discipline, that’s just cosplaying productivity for Instagram. Discipline is doing the stuff you promised yourself you’d do, even when you’re tired, bored, or straight up not in the mood. It’s studying when your brain says scroll, it’s cooking a simple meal instead of ordering junk, it’s closing the gap between what you said you’d do and what you actually do.

The brutal truth is, discipline is boring most of the time. It’s not hype, it’s not motivation, it’s the tiny choices stacked day after day that nobody claps for. That’s why people give up, because there’s no dopamine rush in doing the same thing consistently. But that’s where growth is, fr.

Discipline is not about perfection, it’s about trust. Every time you keep a promise to yourself, you build self-respect. Every time you break it, you train yourself to not believe your own words. And once you stop trusting yourself, it’s game over. That’s why the real flex isn’t a 5 AM routine, it’s being able to say “I’ll do it” and then actually doing it, no excuses.

If you slip up, don’t spiral. The real secret is never missing twice. You miss one workout, fine, but don’t miss the next. You procrastinate one day, fine, but don’t let it turn into a week. Discipline is not about being perfect every single time, it’s about refusing to let your bad days outweigh your good ones.

Fr, once you get this, your whole life changes. You stop living in theory and start living in action. And that’s when you separate yourself from 99% of people.



## User comment 1: 

I’ve lived this. If you say you’re going to do something and then you don’t, you lose trust in yourself over time. You kill your self esteem that way. It hurts your relationships. If you can’t follow through for _yourself_, you won’t be following through for everyone else. It’s extra tough when you are a procrastinator, planner, and perfectionist all in one due to adhd. This downward spiral caused me to socially isolate for a while under the guise of “working on myself”. Only to keep procrastinating and feeling worse, like negative compounding interest.

On the flip side of that when I am following through consistently and knocking tasks off my to do lists, I feel almost superhuman. It’s a wonderful feeling knowing you can count on yourself.

Edit- im so glad my experience has resonated with many of you. Feel free to reach out anytime if you need to talk to someone who goes through a similar battle. If you rely on a substance everyday, (weed for me) you _need_ to cut that out and fix your dopamine reward system first. Soon you will be getting that dopamine from doing small tasks instead, it truly works. Best of luck


## User comment 2:

I’ve slowly implemented this with a Ta-Da list.

Everything I did that day goes on the list. Time blindness is very much a thing in my life, so seeing a list of things I did get done (even mundane _brushed teeth, took the dogs out, did the dishes_) reminds me of what I have accomplished. Then I can look at my tasks and to-do list and plan out my next day/week with a clearer image of what I put off and where I have time to _hang towel rack_ or whatever.

# How I went from rock bottom to disciplined in 6 months.


Hi, I wish to share my journey of getting disciplined. I hope you will take something away from this :). I would like to mention that I'm not a native English speaker, so forgive me for any grammar and/or spelling mistakes.

TLDR; Build positive habits on a foundation of willpower, not motivation.

Start reading non-fiction and apply it in your life. Work on your physiology, it should be the foundation for productivity and discipline.

Lessen the amount of superstimuli in your life to get more dopamine (motivation).

Flow activities should be the goal in life, not mind numbing pleasure.

Start a bullet journal where you color code all activities you do each day positive or negative.

It all started when I realized I had hit rock bottom. I was getting up at 3pm everyday. Only ate junkfood, lay in bed watching YouTube and smoking a lot of weed. My room was always a complete mess. I completely disregarded my study while I was living of a study loan. Every night I would hang out with a friend who would do the same and we'd smoke weed and watch screens until about 5 am. It really was rock bottom. This went on for a long time until I saw I had to change my life.

## HABIT BUILDING

I read a book called The Slight Edge. The idea of the book was that with consistent, incremental improvement, anyone could reach anything. It also debunked the idea of a 'quantum leap', which at first I believed in. I liked the idea and started implementing it to form positive habits in my life. I started with nofap, meditation, reading, cleaning and some more. I made a lot of mistakes when I first started out. So some advice on habit building I have accumulated is this:

DON'T TRUST MOTIVATION. Motivation is good if it's there but it shouldn't be the foundation of the habits you create. Why? because motivation isn't always there, and when it's gone you also lose the habits that you build on top of it. I experienced this a lot of times. I would have a streak of 100+ days meditation, miss 3 days and completely give up until I had the motivation again to start over.

So how can I build habits then? Do it based on willpower. The big difference is not to say to yourself "I'm gonna read 20 pages every day because I'm so motivated to gain knowledge." But that you say "I'm going force myself to start reading everyday because I will have enough willpower to always do that."

The key is that if you make the requirement so small that you can always do it, you will never fail. So doing for example 1 pushup everyday. You will never fail that requirement. But if you have very little motivation one day and think about doing 20 pushups, it just seems intimidating and you don't do it.

Some people might say "only starting to read or doing 1 push up will never get me anywhere." And I agree, but the thing is that you can do more. And you will usually do more. Once you forced yourself, with willpower, to get into push up position and do 1 push up, you'll probably think "I can do one more, and one more" and so on. Same for reading, once you've forced yourself to sit in a chair with a book and started reading, you wont stop after just 1 word. You will do a lot more than the initial requirement more times then not. It will also give you a sense of "I did this". Especially if your requirement is, say, 1 push up, and you do 10. You will have done 9 extra. As opposed to when you require yourself to do 20 and do 10. You will have done 10 too little.

Try it right now, force yourself on the ground to do one push up. I'm sure you have the willpower to do that.

The key is to make the requirement so small you will never fail it. Build the habit on a foundation of willpower, if motivation comes along, that's great.

## READING

The one habit that has done the most for my life is to read non-fiction. I bought an e-reader and started to read daily. I recommend buying an e-reader a lot. Here are some of the benefits:

- Very portable, whenever I'm in public transport I pull it out and read some pages.

- Buying books is instant and you can read anything you'd like

- If you have little money there are a lot of places where you can download ebooks for free

- It has a backlight, so you can read in your bed, lying on your side, in the dark. Most come with blue light filters as well.

Some of the benefits of reading non-fiction

- You can learn directly from great people

- There are books on anything that you find interesting (for me it's psychology)

- There are a lot of self-help books on the market that will give you advice that you can practically apply in your life.

I'm sure there are a lot more, but for the sake of not writing a book as a post this will do.

I think the most important thing as a prerequisite for discipline is good physiology. If you aren't feeling good it's hard to do things that would count as disciplined behavior. So that's why I would recommend reading some books about physiology.

Books that have had a profound impact on my life are; Mini habits, Meet Your Happy Chemicals, The HeartMath Solution, The Willpower Instinct, Cupid's Poisoned Arrow, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience and Awareness Through Movement.

If your read all these books you will learn; how to create healthy habits in your life without making it hard; how your brain chemicals work; how to instantly lower stress and deal with negative thought and emotion, how willpower works, why it matters and how to get more of it; how orgasm induces neurochemical brain changes for 2 weeks and how it's evolutionary designed to break romantic relationships; what a flow experience is, and why it should be the goal for all activities in life to turn into one; that everyone stops progressing in the most basic things like breathing, posture etc. because only the minimal in life is needed to get on, it also provides lessons on how to improve these parts of life.

Gaining knowledge in this field will give you the ability to make the changes in your life that will benefit your overall feeling. Feeling good overall, in your body and mind, is required for doing productive things.

## DOPAMINE

I'm a psychology student so when I got into self help I was naturally interested in the brain's place in self improvement.

Dopamine is the key player here. Most people think dopamine is responsible for 'pleasure'. This is a big misunderstanding. Dopamine is actually responsible for 'wanting' and motivation.

When the dopamine part of the brain was first discovered, it was discovered in rats. The researchers hooked up a lever to the rats' dopamine circuit to shock the dopamine circuit (mimicking dopamine release) whenever the rats would pull the lever. The rats soon ignored anything else and only pulled the lever until they died of starvation and fatigue. Next the researchers (this one is a bit cruel) would have 2 levers on the opposite sides of a cage that would produce a 'dopamine hit' if pressed after the other. To make it interesting they put an electrically charged grid in between that would give the rats a painful shock if they walked over it. So now the rats would have to cross the grid every time they wanted another 'dopamine hit'. Shockingly (lol) the rats would run across it until they burned of their legs and couldn't walk anymore. The researchers concluded from these experiments that this dopamine circuit was responsible for creating pleasure. Nowadays this is proved to be wrong and the actual function of the dopamine circuit is believed to be wanting and motivation.

Most things people like to do give a lot of dopamine (much more than anything would have given in nature). Things like watching TV (or netflix), internet, drugs, processed foods, porn, gambling and videogames. Things that give us a lot of dopamine tend to be addicting. No wonder I was only smoking, watching screens and lying in bed when I hit rock bottom.

Now, why should you care? The reason is very simple. Exposure to high dopamine for longer periods of time REDUCES DOPAMINE RECEPTORS. Lower dopamine receptors give you lower motivation, lower concentration and less mental sharpness. With there being a lot of supernaturally high dopamine giving activities and substances available to us we should all be aware in what amount we should consume them. This is the reason why there are more college and university dropouts more than ever before. Why so many people are unhappy at work. And why there are more cases of depression than ever before (depression is linked to lower dopamine).

Big companies know about this and use it to sell us as much as possible and keep them on their platforms for longer. They put the exact amount of sugar in all foods so that we like it the most, they design their platforms so you stay on them a lot (Facebook and Instagram), they implement gambling into games so that we play them more (Fortnite).

So what to take away from all this? Lessen the amount of activities you do each day that give you a lot of dopamine and don't add anything to your life. This will give you a natural amount of dopamine receptors again and will make it a lot easier to stay concentrated while reading or learning an instrument for example.

## FLOW ACTIVITIES

1 book that has made a profound impact on my life is the book Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience. The idea of the book is that there are certain activities that for which your brain needs 100% of it's power to be focused on the activity. This is when you reach a 'Flow state'. In this state you lose the idea of the self, you lose track of time and are only focused on the task at hand. For example when you drive somewhere and you get there and don't remember how you got there.

Flow occurs when your skill matches the challenge of the activity. When your skill is too high, you will be bored, when the challenge is too high you will be anxious.

The key idea from this book, for me, was the difference between pleasure and enjoyment. Pleasure activities are ones that give the high amount of dopamine. Whereas enjoyable activities also give dopamine, but also make you better at the task and will often produce a state of Flow. Enjoyment produces growth, pleasure does not.

I think that any activity in life that is not a pure pleasure activity can be made into a flow activity. It's one of my goals in life to fill my day with enjoyable activities. It made me realize I wanted to fill my day with making music and reading, not with smoking and watching TV.

## JOURNALING

One of the best habits I have build is journaling. More specifically bullet journaling. I'm not sure if this is the official way to do it but this is what I do and what works for me.

People pay coaches a lot of money to do something they can do themselves as well; give feedback. All a coach does is tell you what you've done, and where you can improve. This is something you can do yourself easily by bullet journaling.

My method: I have a simple notebook where I use the left and right page for 1 day. In the morning I write down some things I want to do that day on the left page. If there are things I wanted to do yesterday I write them down for today. I also write a bit about how I feel. Recently I've been doing some affirmations as well on that page. You can skip this entire left page, I personally like it, but I can understand how it's a bit much for some people. You could also experiment with it and change it up how you like it.

The real magic (and the reason I made the coach analogy) is on the right page. Here is where I write down every influential activity I do. I won't write down things like 'have breakfast' or 'short chat with roommate'. I write down everything that has a positive or a negative meaning (some things are neutral like doing groceries). Then at the end of the day I will use a marker to color code every activity either green (positive) or red (negative). So for example:

(green) get up at 6am

(green) take a cold shower

(green) meditate

(red) smoke a joint

(red) waste an hour on Netflix

(green) go to school

(red) hangout with X toxic friend and drink beer

I hope you see what I meant with the coach analogy now. You will get a lot of feedback on what you do each day. When I first started doing this I was shocked by how much red activities I had and made it a mission to get more green activities in there. It was slow progress but steadily it got better.

If you don't like the left part of the journaling (which is how most people recommend it), I would advice you to try the right page. If you're gonna do one, it should be the right page. See it as a free life coach.

## SLEEP SCHEDULE

When I was at rock bottom my schedule was the furthest away from perfect that it could possibly be. One of the first things I changed that lasted was my sleeping schedule. I was done waking when it's almost dark already and still being tired. Also I noticed that everything I did in the late evening wasn't productive (or even counterproductive) like watching screens and doing drugs

There are good reasons to wake up early (5-6-7 AM). The best sleep you can get is the sleep between 10 and 12. If you're still awake at 00:00 you will produce cortisol and adrenaline to keep you awake. This isn't healthy. Good sleep improves cognitive function, vitality and motivation by a lot. There are many more benefits to a good sleeping schedule, and I think it's well known that it's a lot better. However most people think it's hard to change their schedule.

It's not. This is how you do it;

- Set your alarm at your goal wake up time (EG 6 am)

- When it goes, get out of bed, immediately eat breakfast

- Don't sleep the rest of the day

- Make sure you stop all screens by 9:30 and are in bed before 10:00

- Set the alarm again, you will most likely wake up before it goes.

It's as easy as this, now all you have to do is to stick with it. Start enjoying the vast amount if time you have available in the morning.

# My grandma (96) made discipline so simple


For a long time, I was stuck in this cycle where I'd only be productive when I felt like it.

If I was in a bad mood, I'd tell myself to wait until tomorrow. When I was tired, I'd take a Netflix break. If I was stressed about something, I'd procrastinate until my headspace cleared up.

One day, my grandma was watching me complain about how I couldn't get anything done because I was "too anxious" about some work project.

She just looked at me and said, "You know, during the war, we didn't have the luxury of waiting until we felt good to do what needed doing."

Then she told me something I'll never forget:

**You need to seperate your actions from your feelings!**

She said most people think their feelings and their actions are married to each other. Happy means productive, sad means lazy, scared means stop. But that's just a story we tell ourselves.

"I didn't feel like rationing food or working on the farm. But I did it anyway. Not because I ignored my feelings, but because I did it WITH my feelings."

When I complained that it's different now, that it's harder to stay disciplined with all the distractions and the flood of choices, she didn't argue with me.

She just nodded and said, "You're probably right. But here's what I learned: don't lie to yourself by using your feelings as an excuse.

Don't say: "I'm stressed, so I can't do it."

She told me to change the narrative and tell myself: "I'm stressed, that's fine, so I'll do it stressed."

Now when I catch myself thinking "I don't feel like working out," I flip it to "I'm unmotivated, so I'll work out unmotivated. What's type of workout can I even do when I'm unmotivated?"

I figured that the problem with discipline is not the doing, it's the starting.

And my grandma's advice made the starting part extremely easy for me.

Today, I actually don't complain about distractions anymore. I use them to reverse-engineer my feelings and to turn them into a booster for action.

Every time I scroll social media mindlessly, I use a few tools (can recommend these [Reddit resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stopscrolling/wiki/index/)) to recognize. Then I reflect on my emotions and what type of action I'm avoiding (work, gym, chores, ...).

Then I close my eyes and hear my grandma. A minute later, my phone is gone.

Absolute legend that lady, really hope I have her for some more years.

Do you have some more good advice from your grandparents how to become and stay disciplined?

# I summarized all the top posts of the top self-help subreddits of all time into a cheatsheet.


## THEORY:

(Long time lurker, but this sub is pretty positive so I feel like I can share)

I had a theory.

The theory was that we are surrounded by information. In the sea of information, if we could sort all the most useful information into one book, we could provide a manual of life changing advice & help into one brief guide.

But how do we organize what is most important?

What better way to advocate for something being useful than an upvote right?

So I decided to find all the top self-help reddit threads of all time and read through all the top posts of this year. Then, I combined all the most common advice into a cheat sheet, with the most common advice prioritized at the top.

My end goal is to one day provide a "Basic Human Needs" course, where I could hopefully pass along all the useful advice I've collected from the over 300+ self-help books I've read and (literally) thousands of articles & posts I've combed through over time and form a virtual big brother / virtual mentor created from the internet.

(I never had a father to teach me stuff. Thanks to you all, I actually feel prepared for life.)


## METHOD:

I first went to [http://redditmetrics.com/top](http://redditmetrics.com/top) and combed through the top 800 subreddits that had anything to do with self-help. These include getdisciplined, lifehacks, personalfinance, startup, and lots more.

I then opened up each subreddit, where I sorted by the top posts over the past year, and began to comb through each subreddit for common themes. Initial phases were rather difficult, because I had to type up anything that sounded like it would come up again.

After documenting all the themes, I then grabbed a new document and put together a clean list of all the things that began to repeat.

Anywhere that you see a x2, x3, etc. That is the number of times a concept is repeated almost verbatim in a post. Otherwise, it is ranked by how often the concept was loosely repeated.

I am fully aware that this isn't as scientific as I'd like this to be. I plan to do this again for All-Time, attach the spreadsheet of the data analysis, a list of subreddits analyzed and the posts within. I did not have enough time to do this over the weekend I could dedicate to this project.

**WARNING:** This is a prototype and it's ugly. Also, none of this is my opinion - just others.


## RESULTS:

### Success:

1. Optimism makes people perform better. Most importantly, the optimism that literally anything can be defeated with enough effort. Every obstacle is _merely_ a challenge, not a threat. x 8
    
2. Habits are what form and deform your life. Humans are short-sighted. Build a ritual that will, much like compound interest, build an amazing life. x6  
    Working out twice a day for a week won’t do much. But a year could make for a transformation. Failure is not one dramatic fall, but a series of small failures, compounded over a longer period. X 5
    
3. Scale slowly. An overnight success still had 1 step up goals every hour. A billion dollar company once only had a goal of a million dollars. Set numerous small, achievable, bite sized goals - as opposed to a few, huge chunky goals. X 4
    
4. Authenticity is king. People enjoy authentic people, respect authentic people and welcome authentic people. x 4
    
5. Common sense beats all rules, stipulations and otherwise. You likely know most of what you learn, it’s simply being reorganized to fit your mind better. When it’s time to take action, trust that you know what you’re doing and focus solely on moving. x 3
    
6. Success comes from trying something, failing and modifying the action - Thousands of times. No amount of preparation (beyond the basic) can prepare you for the first day with sharks. ACTION + MODIFICATION = RESULTS x 3
    
7. Show small amounts of gratitude every day. Make it apart of your ritual. The gratitude forces you to focus on the things you are happy about. Small gratitude is low commitment and high reward. X 2
    
8. Establish 3 to 20 second barriers between bad habits. Take batteries out the remote. Put junk food in trunk of car. It won’t stop you completely. But it will decrease significantly. Make positive habits easier. Pack a healthy lunch. X 2
    
9. A huge part of succeeding at something is simply showing up. Even if that means you just walked in the door and back out. If you show up, the math says you’ll succeed, eventually. X 3
    
10. Go 150% + beyond what you are expected to do. This is a 100% way to gain immediate traction. Applied with consistency can skyrocket results. x 2
    
11. Practice task isolation. The only thing that matters in that moment is the task at hand. Work on that task only until you are ready to stop. Nothing else matters until. X 2
    
12. Constantly be evaluating yourself. Every year, every month, week, day, hour. - Do this 100% objectively and healthily. The more you look at yourself objectively and decide what you’re doing right and wrong, the better feedback you can use to improve. X 2
    
13. If you are always the smartest person in the room, you’re probably in a room full of idiots or you’re lying to yourself.
    
14. Double down on your strengths. Neutralize your weaknesses. Make them just capable enough to swim still water.
    
15. Adaptation is the key to survival. You cannot run over a jungle, but with the right small, frequent adjustments, you can run through a jungle.
    
16. Discipline is not just following a plan when you need a plan, but following the plan when you’ve succeeded. Make a plan and follow it, regardless of your emotions.
    
17. When you first wake up, try breathing faster and faster until hyperventilation. It makes your body kick into awake mode quickly.
    
18. Try fasting from a bad habit completely. Replace it with something less bad. Over time, you can replace a lot of small bad habits with less bad habits and get big change.
    
19. Organization, habits and the process of planning is actually all simply tools to clear space in your brain. You cannot use a car efficiently if it is jammed to the ceiling with clothes and furniture that belong in your house. And the furniture and clothes can’t be used correctly either.
    
20. Take stock in the understanding that 90% of successful people are doing a lot of hustle underneath the glam and money. They wake up early, they skip parties and they work - A LOT.
    
21. Automate literally every task you do not enjoy. It will make your life focus on the things you do enjoy.
    
22. Most habits can be changed by finding the belief rooted to it and finding all the evidence you can to break it. - “The gym is a chore.” *Watch documentaries about people who love the gym* "I love sugary foods" *Watch documentaries about sugar causing disease* - You are what you subscribe to.
    
23. Tell no one your goals. Talking gives you a rush of endorphins and dopamine. You “dope yourself out” on talking and never get anywhere.
    
24. No amount of regret can bring back the dead. Love immensely and give your friends and family what they deserve as soon as possible and as often as possible.
    
25. Chain together successful tasks and create the illustration of commitment, thus reducing your likelihood to miss out. - Crossing off days on a calendar chains a habit and thus reduces the chance to break it.
    
26. Stage every commitment so you only give what you get back, and scale it slowly. Put in 1 cent, if it gives back 1 cent, then put in 5 cents. If it gives back 5 cents, continue. Never Give 100% to an idea you haven’t tested at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% etc.
    
27. Never show your cards first in a negotiation. The offer they have in mind may be much higher than you’re thinking.
    
28. In a dispute, ask for proof of everything. Make the process draining for the other party if you’re in the right and they are forcing you to wade through mud.
    

### Finance:

1. Every successful person saves money. EVERY. SUCCESSFUL. PERSON. SAVES. MONEY. Save, at the very least, 10%
    
2. Every successful person invests. Invest in a bank, invest in real estate, invest in yourself. No matter how you invest, it’s the only way to grow. Spend your money on things that grow. - This includes your health.
    
3. Do not skip on insurance. The peace of mind that disaster will not ruin you is worth the duty paid.
    
4. One of the most common failures in business & personal is the mismanagement of funds. Be very meticulous with how you spend your money.
    

### Social:

1. Listen to people. Ask open-ended questions to get someone to talk. Why, what and how questions. To enhance listening, look for a one sentence life lesson to take from every story / interaction. x 4
    
2. You are upset because no one calls you to do things. So is the person who didn’t call you. Initiate activity. This is a solid way to be invited to more things, meet new people and have fun. X 2
    
    1. Group activities are always more comfortable.
        
    2. Have a specific plan in place of who, what, when, where & why.
        
    3. Sometimes the event will fall apart. This is common. Do it anyways. It’s worth it.
        
    4. Social people invite others out when they feel lonely. Antisocial people wait for a phone call. Antisocial people have a higher probability of being lonely.
        
3. Traveling & expanding your social circle makes you more confident in who you are.
    
4. Be 10% more excited than the person you are talking to in positive conversations.
    
5. You have value to add to every interaction. Whether it’s with a CEO or a janitor. No matter your past - If you’ve burned many bridges, at least you had bridges to burn.
    
6. If 10 people in a row reject you as a friend, that’s only .000000015 percent of the world’s population. You’ve got a whole lot more to choose from.
    
7. Small talk is the door to deep friendship. You must make small talk first. You first said “Hi” to your significant other, you first had an interview at a company. People need to know you won’t stab them before they want to hang out.
    
8. Letting go of the thought that people have to like you is the best decision you will ever make. People would have liked or disliked you regardless of how lightly you tread.
    
9. Talk to people’s emotions. A metalhead and a classical music lover can connect on how emotional they get during a raw, deep piece.
    

### Health:

1. Get 6-8 hours of sleep. It can cause huge detriments to your wellbeing to get less. X 3
    
2. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. X 2
    
3. Sleep is one of the more important aspects of health, right beside nutrition and exercise. Master these three and you are doing well.
    
4. Optimum sleep temperature is 61-64 degrees F. Optimal sleep warm up is 1 hour before bed to begin process attempting sleep. - No screens, no exercise, no stress.
    
5. Meditation provides a range of health benefits.
    
6. Exposure to nature prevented hay fever and other illnesses in cavemen.
    
7. Stem cells regrow the body.
    
8. Alcohol consumption linked to many diseases we didn’t think - such as Alzheimer's, Dementia, Cancer, etc. Alcohol companies are funding research to make alcohol okay or “healthy”. X 2
    
9. Not exercising is worse for your health than smoking, diabetes and heart disease.
    
10. Tobacco use linked to a quarter of a billion life-years lost vs. illegal drugs accounting for only tens of millions.
    
11. Education linked to better health than income. Intelligent people make smarter health decisions that prevent the need for reactive, potentially too-late healthcare.
    
12. Dropping smartphones from evening activity led to 93.6% of participants opting to keep their phones off at night. - Increased happiness, focus & wellbeing.
    
13. Dark chocolate is a superfood. Good for health and mind.
    

### Business:

1. WHO matters most, then WHY, then HOW, then WHAT, then WHEN. Hire the right people with the right motives who follow a great plan and what you do and when you do it should work out on it’s own. x 2
    
2. Facebook, Uber, AirBnb, eBay - All got their start connecting two people together who could help each other. None have inventory, shipping centers, etc.
    
3. Buy low, sell high. Every business is in the business of buying something cheaper than they sell it. Simplify your business by asking what you’re buying for cheap, and selling for more.
    
4. Personal letters are the only way to get through a noisy world today. Find a way to personalize every communication you send.
    
5. The product will sell itself. Build a product that people will talk about.
    
6. Test EVERYTHING. We live in a hyper-feedback world. Run test after test and build on what works. Methodically test every single aspect of your business.
    
7. “Big Picture” thinkers don’t work well in a startup. You need detail oriented thinkers to calculate every move and thought.
    
8. Ideas are like treadmills. It can be a catalyst to something great, but will require you to execute methodically and frequently. A treadmill without work is worthless.
    
9. One of the most common failures in business & personal is the mismanagement of funds. Be very meticulous with how you spend your money.
    
10. The best marketing is word of mouth. Talk to the loudest birds and get noticed effortlessly.
    
11. Know your worth. Ask for that raise. It costs money to replace an employee, and it could be a significant amount.
