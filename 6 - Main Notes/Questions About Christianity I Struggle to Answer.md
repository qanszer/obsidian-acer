# Other People's Questions About Christianity I Struggle to Answer


## About the Book of Job

- How would anyone ever be okay about this story? God is a gambling man… betting with the devil that Job would still follow him even after Satan’s deviltry. This story is not about having optimism in God’s plan; it demonstrates that God allows those to suffer for his appeasement. Would you really be okay with losing everything dear for you? Even at the end, giving Job more children is supposed to heal him from losing his prior children? Such a bizarre story that tries to explain the importance of both hope and justice. If God can create the complexities of this Earth, then why is punishing the evil so complex? [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQwnH8th_fs)
	
- Sounds to me like the kind of thing the rich and powerful inflict on the weak and defenseless, suffer and question not why you are suffering... god failed job, then flexed on him, and then what? silently admitted his mistake and fixed it? (let me just break this down, so Job here whom was a good person, suffered for the entertainment and experiments of higher beings, tortured in both body and soul, to prove what he already was? and you mfs see that as wisdom?) [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA&t=50s)
	
- What am I missing? How did Job get double what he lost? He lost his wife, all his kids and family, they all died. How is this restoring Job? & a book of wisdom. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA&t=50s)
	- He got double what he lost because at the time this was written children were viewed (at least in the Hebrew scriptures) as replaceable commodities. You can decide whether that's admirable or not. His wife did survive; she was the one who did all the work birthing the ten replacement children.
	
- The first verse of that book states Job was perfect, and yet that didn't stop God from saying it was perfectly okay to kill all of his kids, take everything from him, and then afflict him with disease on a whim. That book, combined with God making things worse when I asked him for help, is why I can't trust him. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA&t=50s)
	
- Satan literally gaslit god into destroying man's life and we are supposed to think this god is righteous? [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA&t=50s) 
	
- How does reading the book of Job answer the problem of suffering anyway? God allows billions of people to suffer just to prove a point? People in the real world don't even get material possessions back like Job did, much less replacement children for those that died. This is not a depiction of a being deserving of worship. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA&t=50s)
	
- Just tell me why God created me without my permission he knows most of his children would be in hell, then why hee created them? [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA&t=50s)
	
- But i couldn't still wrapped my head around, that this explain nothing but telling us that God in His Almighty do and decide whatever He deems right in His own terms and what's left to do for us is to trust Him. But apart from Job's story, some people who believed like Job dont have the same ending. They end up die in their agony whilst still praise the Lord. And to me, personally, still pretty absurd. I get it that we cannot praise the Lord just for what we gain or loss, but that just nullify the meaning in Job's story. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA&t=50s)



## Someone's Attempt of Explaining Job

The book of Job is not fundamentally about why a righteous man suffers. It is about whether God’s governance of the universe is just, trustworthy, and grounded in love rather than transaction. From its opening scene, the question is not Job’s character but God’s moral order. The accuser’s charge is sweeping and theological: that no one loves God freely, that righteousness is merely payment for protection, and that God’s rule collapses the moment blessing is withdrawn. Job becomes the test case not because he is expendable, but because he already stands as living evidence against that accusation. 

This is why God’s silence dominates the book. God is not absent; He is restrained. To intervene mid-trial, to explain Himself while the accusation is still being argued, would validate the very claim being made against Him. A judge who interrupts proceedings to defend himself concedes the weakness of his own justice. God allows the charge to unfold fully, not to torment Job, but to expose the lie at the heart of the accuser’s worldview: that love and loyalty only exist when incentivized. 

Job’s friends represent the human impulse to rescue God by sacrificing truth. In Job 4 and throughout their speeches, they insist that suffering must be directly caused by God as punishment, that pain is proof of guilt, and that divine justice must always be immediately legible. In doing so, they actually repeat the accuser’s logic. They make God the author of arbitrary suffering and reduce righteousness to a mechanical system of reward and penalty. Their theology sounds pious, but God later condemns it precisely because it misrepresents Him. 

Job, by contrast, refuses both easy blame and easy explanations. He does not curse God, but he also refuses to lie about reality. His protest is not rebellion; it is relational fidelity under extreme pressure. This is why Job’s most profound insight is his cry for a mediator, someone who can stand between God and humanity without collapsing justice or silencing suffering. Job senses that the problem is not simply pain, but distance: the absence of an advocate who can bridge heaven and earth without distortion. 

That cry finds its answer in Christ. Where Job longed for a daysman who could lay a hand on both God and man, Christ fulfills that role as advocate, mediator, and witness. He does not explain suffering away; He enters it. He does not short-circuit justice; He satisfies it. He does not silence accusation by force; He defeats it by truth and self-giving love. What Job experiences without explanation, Christ reveals through incarnation. 

Revelation completes the picture Job never saw. It names the accuser explicitly and shows his accusations silenced not by argument, but by faithful witness, endurance, and the vindication of God’s character. The heavenly courtroom that opens Job also closes in Revelation, where the charge that God is unloving, unjust, or manipulative finally collapses under the weight of sacrificial love. 

God’s final speech in Job does not justify suffering case by case because the book is not about justification in that sense. Instead, God reorients reality. He shows that wisdom, care, and moral order extend far beyond human calculation, and that trust in God’s character must precede understanding of His ways. Job is vindicated not because he never questioned, but because he never abandoned the relationship even when answers were withheld. 

In the end, Job teaches that suffering does not disprove God’s love, silence does not equal absence, and unanswered pain does not negate justice. The book exists to defend the integrity of God’s rule against the deepest accusation imaginable, and it does so by pointing forward to the only true resolution: a mediator who reveals that God’s love is not transactional, not coercive, and not fragile, but costly, faithful, and victorious.
