# Journal on Floor Sleeping


### 2/15/26 - Setting it up

My current setup is a yoga mat underneath and a comforter. The feel is pretty good right now, I'll see when I try to sleep for the first night tonight.


### 2/16/26

It worked. I immediately got up after my alarm. 
I feel energized to boot, not groggy. 
I ended up having a productive morning because of it (barley, laundry, withdraw and buy banana, bath, etc)

My only concern is my quality of sleep. I probably did not get much or any REM sleep at all, because I kept waking up for 1-3 seconds throughout my sleep (maybe 5-10 times total).
