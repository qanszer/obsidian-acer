# Week 1 - Real Faith Triumphs
01/11/26

**Main Scripture**: James 1:1-18

## Main Points

1. Real faith rejoices
2. Real faith prays
3. Real faith endures

---
### 01 - Real Faith Rejoices

#### Real Faith

- Is recognizing and trusting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior
- Is anchored in God and His truth---not in circumstances or feelings
- Is evidenced by obedience, works, and a transformed life
- perseveres to the end


**2 Corinthians 13:5**
- Test **yourselves**, don't test others

**Matthew 7:20-23**
- You will know by their fruits (evidence/actions) if they are a real Christian
- Are you really living a life of obedience? 


#### James

- The half-brother of Jesus, but he did not mention it himself
- Not a disciple
- Jesus' brothers did not believe in Him, but Jesus rose from the dead, He appeared to James personally before appearing to the other disciples
- Wrote the book of James to determine counterfeit believers


**James 1:1-4**
- A Christian is known based on how he handles his trials in life
- Some trials are self-inflicted---bad decisions
- We are **commanded** to rejoice when we face various trials; it is a testing of our faith that produces endurance
- Endurance makes us perfect and complete, lacking in nothing---a mature Christian
- The purpose of suffering is to transform our character
- Character is always built on the classroom of suffering and pain

**1 Peter 1:6-7**
- Also talks about greatly rejoicing when distressed by various trials

**Hebrews 11:6**
- It is impossible to please God with fake faith

**Romans 10:17**
- Faith comes by hearing and reading the word of God


> When faced with trials, you don't put faith in the situation, you put your faith in God


---

### 02 - Real Faith Prays

**James 1:5-6**
- When you come to God by praying, don't doubt

**James 1:7**
- Double-minded man: someone who asks God for His will, and only considers God's response; as if His will is an advice wherein he can accept or reject
- Don't be double minded

Wisdom is knowing whether rich or poor, I am rich in God knowing 

#### 2 Ways in Responding to Problems?

1. Faith in God's character 


**Romans 8:18**
- The suffering of this time is nothing compared to the glory of

**Romans 8:28-29**
- God causes all things to work together for good. But this promise is limited to people who love God


#### Chuch Colson

- powerful man who was sent to jail at the height of his career
- God transformed him in his bad time
- "Failure was the best thing that ever happened to me... The real legacy of my life was forged in a prison cell."
- "Losing everything was necessary... to gain what truly "


---

### 03 - Real Faith Perseveres

**James 1:13-14**
- When God allows you to have problems, it is designed to build us up. Only when we fall to it 
- God **allows** temptations to come to us, but He Himself does not make it; it is by our own sinful nature that we have temptations.

> God is after our character


#### Fanny Crosby

- a blind woman
- "If perfect earthyl sight were offered me tomorrow, I would not accept it. When I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior."

# Week 2 - Real Faith Obeys God's Word
January 18, 2026
**James 1:19-27**


## Main Points

1. Evident Transformation
2. Consistent Application
3. Unefiled Religion


---

### Why some presume to be Christians:

1. Cultural/familial background
2. Social cohesion and benefits
3. Association with good morals
4. Surface-level practices
5. A "belief-only" view
6. Neglecting personal spiritual growth

> Bruce Wilkinson
> 
> *"Faith without works cannot be called faith. Faith must work; it must produce; it must be visible. Verbal faith is not enough; mental faith is insufficient. Faith must move into action."*
> 


**Real faith must have evidence.** It must have actions


### About Anger

**Anger is not in itself sinful**. But most of what people do while being angry is what can be called sin---violence, murder, tantrums, bitterness, resentment, hostility, silent treatment, and many more.

Find better ways to deal with anger. Direct your energy to a positive action instead. Great examples include:

- Exercising while angry
- Doing a task you've been holding off while angry

January 25, 2026
**James 2:1-13**


## Main Points

1. Stop Showing Favoritism
2. See People's God's-Way
3. Show Christlike Mercy


**The Practical Exam of Real Faith**
- How do you respond to trials?
- How do you respond to temptation?

- How would you feel if you have been discriminated by someone?


### 02 - See People God's-Way

Who's easier to share the Gospel with? The rich or the poor?

# Week 4 - Real Faith Works
February 8, 2026
**James 2:14-26**


Examine your faith. Make sure Jesus Christ is in you. But how do you know?

According to Jesus:

"So then, you will know them by their fruits. Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord', will enter the kingdom of heaven. but he who knows my Father will obey."

You cannot be a Christian if you don't obey. A Christian is simply a follower of Jesus

## Main Points

1. Acts not just talks (v14-17)
2. Surrenders not just knows (v18-20)
3. Obeys not just believes (v21-26)


### 01 - Acts Not Just Talks

A fruit tree because it is alive. It is not alive because it bears fruit.

A Christian bears good works, because they are alive in God. It is not the other way around. 

Christianity is inside out. Because we're loved by God, we can show the same thing to others.

| Paul                                                               | James                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How a person is saved                                              | How saved people live                                                      |
| Focuses on the root of salvation: salvation by grace through faith | Focuses on the fruit of salvation: faith is shown to be real through works |
| Against legalism                                                   |                                                                            |
| Faith in Christ transforms                                         |                                                                            |


### 02 - Surrenders Not Just Knows

Knowing is not equal to salvation. Just because you know that the only way to heaven is Jesus

Demons know Jesus. They know about the judgement day, about salvation, and all that relate to it. They know all of that, but they are not of Jesus. Why? Because of where their heart is.

"They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him."


**The Honored Society** 
- A book about a mafia boss that believe they are Christians
- They are Christians in culture, but not a Christians in heart


### 03 - Obeys Not Just Believes

Real faith grows---it is not perfect.
