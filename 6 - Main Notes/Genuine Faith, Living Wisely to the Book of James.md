---
## 01 - Real Faith Rejoices

### Real Faith

- Is recognizing and trusting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior
- Is anchored in God and His truth---not in circumstances or feelings
- Is evidenced by obedience, works, and a transformed life
- perseveres to the end


**2 Corinthians 13:5**
- Test **yourselves**, don't test others

Matthew 7:20-23
- You will know by their fruits (evidence/actions) if they are a real Christian
- Are you really living a life of obedience? 


### James

- The half-brother of Jesus, but he did not mention it himself
- not a disciple
- Jesus' brothers did not believe in Him, but Jesus rose from the dead, He appeared to James personally before appearing to the disciples
- Wrote the book of James to determine counterfeit believers


James 1:1-4
- A Christian is known based on how he handles his trials in life
- Some trials are self-inflicted---bad decisions
- We are **commanded** to rejoice when we face various trials; it is a testing of our faith that produces endurance
- Endurance makes us perfect and complete, lacking in nothing---a mature Christian
- The purpose of suffering is to transform our character
- Character is always built on the classroom of suffering and pain

1 Peter 1:6-7
- Also talks about greatly rejoicing when distressed by various trials

Hebrews 11:6
- It is impossible to please God with fake faith

Romans 10:17
- Faith comes by hearing and reading the word of God


> When faced with trials, you don't put faith in the situation, you put your faith in God

## 02 - Real Faith Prays

James 1:5-6
- When you come to God by praying, don't doubt

James 1:7
- Double-minded man: someone who asks God for His will, and only considers God's response; as if His will is an advice wherein he can accept or reject
- Don't be double minded

Wisdom is knowing whether rich or poor, I am rich in God knowing 

### 2 Ways in Responding to Problems?

1. Faith in God's character 


Romans 8:18
- The suffering of this time is nothing compared to the glory of

Romans 8:28-29
- God causes all things to work together for good. But this promise is limited to people who love God


### Chuch Colson

- powerful man who was sent to jail at the height of his career
- God transformed him in his bad time
- "Failure was the best thing that ever happened to me... The real legacy of my life was forged in a prison cell."
- "Losing everything was necessary... to gain what truly "


---

## 03 - Real Faith Perseveres

James 1:13-14
- When God allows you to have problems, it is designed to build us up. Only when we fall to it 
- God **allows** temptations to come to us, but He Himself does not make it; it is by our own sinful nature that we have temptations.

> God is after our character


### Fanny Crosby

- a blind woman
- "If perfect earthyl sight were offered me tomorrow, I would not accept it. When I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior."

# Real Faith Obeys God's Word
January 18, 2026
**James 1:19-27**


## Main Points

1. Evident Transformation
2. Consistent Application
3. Unefiled Religion


---

### Why some presume to be Christians:

1. Cultural/familial background
2. Social cohesion and benefits
3. Association with good morals
4. Surface-level practices
5. A "belief-only" view
6. Neglecting personal spiritual growth


> 
> Bruce Wilkinson
> 
> *"Faith without works cannot be called faith. Faith must work; it must produce; it must be visible. Verbal faith is not enough; mental faith is insufficient. Faith must move into action."*
> 


**Real faith must have evidence.** It must have actions


### About Anger

**Anger is not in itself sinful**. But most of what people do while being angry is what can be called sin---violence, murder, tantrums, bitterness, resentment, hostility, silent treatment, and many more.

Find better ways to deal with anger. Direct your energy to a positive action instead. Great examples include:

- Exercising while angry
- Doing a task you've been holding off while angry
