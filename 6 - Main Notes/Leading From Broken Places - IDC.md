# Leading From Broken Places
February 1, 2026
**1 Peter 5:1-11**


How do you lead from broken places?

## Main Points

1. A Submitted Posture (v1-4)
2. A Sober Perspective (v5-9)
3. A Secure Promise (v10-11)


## 01 - A Submitted Posture
1 Peter 5:1-4

Brokenness shapes how we serve
A broken person knows that he has failed God

I. **Stay Planted in your Place**
- The place of your assignment is the place of your refinement
- God uses people, your environment, your situations, to mold you and build you up
- That is why---do not run away

II. **Serve with the Right Motivation, not for Ego or Earning**
- Serving is a privilege. In other words, you don't have to do it, you get to do it
- "I want to serve Him for the right reason"
- Brokenness destroys a person's ego
- He trusts me after even after I fail Him

III. **Live for the Crown, not for the Crowd**
- "I don't need the applause of the crowd. I just need the approval of God"
- Don't work for the well known, work for the "well done"


## 02 - A Sober Perspective
1 Peter 5:5-9

Ministry is not only spiritual work---it is spiritual warfare.
Brokenness shapes how we fight

IV. **Stay Humble when the Spotlight Finds You**
- Peter had an issue of pride. He was prideful in his commitment to Jesus
- The higher you rise, the lower you must kneel
- "Pride is the carbon monoxide of sin it silently kills you" (Tim Keller)

Brokenness becomes your armor

V. **Hand off the Weight You were Never Meant to Carry**
- "Prayer is the work. Ministry is the gathering of the results"

VI. **Stand Firm When the Enemy Roars**
- You think you can handle the situation. But no, you need to pray
- Brokenness gives you that watchfullness, and teaches us vigilance

VII. **Suffer Well, Knowing You are Not Alone**
- Suffering is inevitable, that is why whenever you undergo through it
- Learn to suffer well
- "God never wastes a wound"
- **Three Types of Breaking**
	1. Expectations
	2. Competence
	3. Self-Sufficiency


## 03 - A Secure Promise
1 Peter 5:10-11

VIII. **Trust a God who Mends What was Torn**
- God repairs your past
- He repositions you for His glory
- 1. RESTORE (Greek: katartizo)
	- to mend what's been broken---like setting a broken bone or medning torn nets
	- like in bones, the place that's been broken will grow back much stronger
- 2. CONFIRM (Greek: sterixo)
	- to make stable, to establish firmly
- 3. STRENGTHEN (Greek: sthenoo)
	- to make strong, to empower
	- just like how Peter denied Jesus at first, but after his season of brokenness and restoration, he became more bold to proclaim the Gospel than others
- 4. ESTABLISH (Greek: themelioo)
	- to lay a foundation, to ground firmly
