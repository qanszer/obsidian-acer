## Reflection

Someone who delights in the law of the Lord is someone who does not follow the world's advice, but takes pleasure in obeying God and His Word

He is someone who takes "delight", meaning he has feelings of extreme pleasure and satisfaction when he reads, studies, and applies God's Word to his life.

We should treat the Word of God as if we are in love with it. Meaning, we want to spend time with it, and when apart, we long for the time when we are with it again.


## Application

- Make God's Word a daily part of your life
- When problems arise, consult on it and let it be your guiding light
- Let it correct us when we are wrong and let it teach us to do what is right
- Trust in it and obey it
