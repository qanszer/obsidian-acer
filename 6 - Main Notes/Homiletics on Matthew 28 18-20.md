# Homiletics on Matthew 28:18-20

*18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. 19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. 20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."*

## **01 - INTRODUCTION**

**[Start with a question]**

Have you ever been given a task that seemed absolutely impossible?
Like binigyan ka ng task na di mo alam kung pano siya gawin, or kahit kung asan ka magsstart para magawa siya? Or something na sobrang overwhelming at bigat na di ka naniniwalang magagawa mo?

Let me paint you a picture: Iimagine mo na part ka sa maliit na group---mga 12 lang kayo. Di kayo mayaman, sikat , o ano. Isa sa inyo call center agent, isa jeepney driver, isa barbero, isa magsasaka, tapos ikaw studyante. And then your leader gives you this assignment:

**"I want you to reach the entire world. Every nation. Every tribe. Every people. Go and make disciples of all 8 billion people on earth."**

Mapapa "ha?" ka nalang bigla diba? Na ang imposible naman niyan.

**Pero that's exactly what happened 2,000 years ago on a hillside in Galilee.**

A small group of Jesus' followers—many of whom had just recently doubted, denied, and abandoned Him during His crucifixion—were given what seemed like Mission Impossible: **Change the entire world.**

And yet, here we are today. Christianity has spread to every continent. Billions have heard the name of Jesus.

**So how did Mission Impossible become Mission Accomplished?**

Yan yung gusto ko ishare sainyo today through Matthew 28:18-20—a passage we call "The Great Commission."

No need pa muna hanapin yung verse, mamaya maya tayo magbabasa. Pero familiar kayo sa passage na yan diba? "Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the...". 

Alam natin yan dati pa, paulit ulit yan sinasabi sa church. 

But let's be honest. Marami satin ang nagsstruggle magfollow sa command na to. 


---


## **02 - NEED**


### **A. Know their struggles related to the topic**

Sige, magshare kayo ng struggle niyo regarding sa pagfollow ng command to go and make disciples. Kahit no need to expound na, ibigay niyo lang yung reason. Pero I want to go first, and then you guys. 

So para saken personally, takot ako sa rejection. Takot ako mawalan ng friends. Na isipin nilang weird ako. How about you guys?


**1. We feel inadequate**

- "I'm not a pastor or missionary. I'm just a student/employee/regular person."
- "I don't know the Bible well enough to teach anyone."
- "I'm scared of rejection. What if people think I'm weird?"

**2. We feel comfortable**

- We've settled into a routine: attend church, listen to sermons, hang out with Christian friends
- Evangelism feels... uncomfortable. Awkward. Risky.
- It's easier to just keep our faith as it is. 


### **B. Paint the picture of why they can't stay where they are**

But here's the reality: **If we ignore the Great Commission, we're not just missing out on an optional activity—we are disobeying a direct command from Jesus Himself.**

And think about it:

- **People around us are dying without Christ.** Yung suicidal friends natin, mga  kakilala natin with depression, mga tumatanda nating relatives, and many other people---most of them may have heard of Jesus already, but don't have a personal relationship with Him. And we have what they desperately need.
- **God has strategically placed you** where you are. Your school, your workplace, your neighborhood—these aren't accidents. You're there for a mission.


### **C. Cast the vision of where they could be**

Now imagine if you took this seriously:

**What if...**

- Your obedience to share the gospel led to one person coming to Christ?
- That person then shared with others, who shared with others?
- Your faithfulness became part of a ripple effect that reaches eternity?

**What if...**

- Instead of living for weekend entertainment and career advancement, you lived with a mission that outlasts your lifetime?
- You experience the joy of seeing someone you led to Christ growing in their faith?
- On your deathbed, you could say with confidence: "I didn't just live for myself. I made disciples."

## 03 - Text


**I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth**

Before Jesus gives the command, He establishes His credentials. And they're not just impressive—they're absolute.

**"All authority"** means:

- Authority over demons and disease (He cast out evil spirits and healed the sick)
- Authority over nature (He calmed storms and walked on water)
- Authority over sin (He forgave sins—something only God can do)
- Authority over death itself (He just rose from the grave!)

**Question: Why does Jesus start with this?**

Because what He's about to command seems **impossible**. These disciples had just watched Jesus die. They had scattered in fear. Some doubted even when they saw Him risen (v. 17). They were weak, afraid, and uncertain.

And Jesus is about to tell them: _"Go change the world."_

**They needed to know: This isn't their mission in their own strength. This is HIS mission with HIS authority.**

**Think of it like this:** If a lieutenant in the military gives you an order, you obey because of his rank. But if the Supreme Commander—the one with all authority—gives you an order, there's no question. You obey.

Jesus isn't making a suggestion. **He's giving an order backed by all authority in heaven and on earth.**

**[ILLUSTRATION - Use contrast]**

When I was younger, my older brother would sometimes try to boss me around: "Clean my room!" I'd say, "You're not the boss of me!"

But when my father said, "Clean your room," that was different. Why? **Authority.**

Jesus isn't our peer making suggestions. He's our King with all authority issuing commands.


**Therefore, go**
- Because Jesus has this authority, we are **therefore** commanded to **go**


**Make disciples of all the nations**
- The command is to **make disciples**, not merely converts or supporters of a cause
- The phrase **make disciples** reminds us that disciples are _made_. **Disciples** are not spontaneously created at conversion; they are the product of a process involving other believers. This making of **disciples** is the power of spreading Christianity.


**Of all the nations**
- Jesus deliberately restricted His work to the Jewish people and previously sent His disciples with the same restriction
- Only in rare exceptions did Jesus minister among the Gentiles
- Now, Jesus commanded the disciples to take the gospel to **all the nations**
	- On this point I had a question, *"Why did Jesus deliberately restrict His ministry to the Jews only at first?"*
	- It was apparently to fulfill specific theological, prophetic, and strategic purposes. You can search it up yourself for more details
	- Jesus chose to minister on the Jews partly due to geographical reasons and also because they, the pormised people, were the furthest from God during that time (pharisees and sadducees)


**Baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit**
- Significantly, when Jesus told them to go to all the nations, He did not tell them to _circumcise_ those who became disciples. Instead, they were to baptize them, suggesting the break with traditional Judaism.
- Those who favor infant baptism answer, albeit unconvincingly: “But it doth not therefore follow, that children of such professors are not to be baptized, for the apostles were commanded to baptize _all nations_; children are a great part of any nation.”
- The words and context certainly indicate that it is **disciples** who are baptized, those of age who can be taught and who can observe the things Jesus commanded.


**Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you**
- Disciples are **made** through **teaching**
- When Jesus says to **"teach them to obey ALL the commands I have given you,"** He means:
	1. **All His ethical teachings** (Sermon on the Mount, love God and neighbor, etc.)
	2. **All His doctrinal teachings** (about Himself, the Father, the Spirit, salvation, judgment, etc.)
	3. **All His practical instructions** (prayer, fasting, dealing with conflict, money, etc.)
	4. **All His warnings** (against hypocrisy, legalism, self-righteousness, hell, etc.)


**I am with you always, even to the end of the age**
- Jesus sent us, His disciples, with a mission to fulfill, but He did not send us alone
- This means that we certainly work _for_ Jesus, but more than that, we work _with_ Jesus. Every step of the way.

### **SUMMARY OF THE TEXT**

**Three truths to hold onto:**

1. **Jesus has ALL authority** → His command is not optional
2. **We are called to MAKE DISCIPLES** → Not just converts, but followers who obey
3. **Jesus is WITH US always** → We have His presence and power

## **04 - APPLICATION** (5-6 minutes)

_"How should I apply this in my life?"_

Let's get practical. What does this look like **this week** for you?

### **Application 1: IDENTIFY your mission field**

**Action:** Write down 3 names of people in your life who don't know Jesus.

**Why:** You can't make disciples of "all nations" if you're not willing to make disciples of the people right in front of you.

**How:**

- Think about your classmates, coworkers, family members, neighbors
- Write their names down
- Commit to praying for them daily this week
- Ask God for opportunities to build relationship and share the gospel

**Make it SPECIFIC:** Not "I'll evangelize when I feel like it," but **"I will pray for [Name] every morning and look for one opportunity this week to ask about their life/invite them to church/share my testimony."**

---

### **Application 2: GROW as a disciple yourself**

**Action:** You cannot teach what you don't know. Commit to deeper Bible study.

**Why:** Jesus said "teach them to obey ALL the commands." How can you teach if you don't know what He commanded?

**How:**

- Continue this hermeneutics practice you're already doing (excellent!)
- Memorize one verse this week (start with Matthew 28:18-20!)
- Join or start a Bible study group
- Read one chapter of the Bible daily

**Make it SPECIFIC:** **"I will spend 15 minutes every morning reading Scripture before I check my phone."**

---

### **Application 3: DEPEND on Christ's presence, not your own strength**

**Action:** Before any evangelistic conversation or opportunity, pray specifically: "Jesus, You are with me. Give me boldness and wisdom."

**Why:** We often fail to share the gospel because we're relying on ourselves. We feel inadequate because we ARE inadequate—but He is not.

**How:**

- When you feel afraid, quote Matthew 28:20: "He is with me always"
- Before starting conversations with non-Christians, briefly pray for His presence
- After sharing (whether it goes well or poorly), thank Him for being with you

**Make it SPECIFIC:** **"When I feel scared to share my faith with [Name], I will stop and pray this exact prayer: 'Jesus, You have all authority and You are with me right now. Help me trust You and speak boldly.'"**

## **05 - CHALLENGE** (3-4 minutes)

_"Why should I do this NOW?"_

Let me close with a story.

**[REAL STORY - Make it personal]**

There's a story about a lifesaving station on a dangerous seacoast where shipwrecks often occurred. It started as a crude little hut with one boat and a few devoted members who kept watch over the sea. Day and night, they went out tirelessly rescuing people from drowning.

Many lives were saved. The station became famous. People donated money. They built a bigger building with comfortable furniture. It became a popular gathering place—a nice club.

But fewer members were interested in the messy work of actually going out to sea to rescue people. So they hired professionals to do it.

One day, a large ship wrecked. The hired crews brought in loads of cold, wet, half-drowned people—dirty and sick. The beautiful club was messed up.

At the next meeting, most members voted to stop the lifesaving activities. "It's unpleasant and hinders our social life," they said.

A few members insisted, "We're a lifesaving station! That's our purpose!"

They were voted down and told: "If you want to save drowning people, start your own station down the coast."

**Which they did.**

**And history repeated itself.** That new station eventually became a comfortable club too. And another station had to be started.

**Today, along that coast, there are many exclusive clubs. But people are still drowning.**

---

**Here's my question for you:**

**What kind of Christian will you be?**

- Will you settle for comfortable club Christianity—attending services, enjoying fellowship, but never getting your hands dirty with the messy work of making disciples?
- Or will you embrace the Great Commission—going to the lost, baptizing new believers, teaching them to obey, trusting that Jesus is with you every step?

**People are drowning all around you.**

- Your classmate who's struggling with depression and doesn't know the hope of Christ
- Your coworker who's chasing success but feels empty inside
- Your family member who's living for the weekend but has no eternal purpose

**They're drowning. And you have the lifeline.**

**Jesus has given you:**

- ✅ **Authority** (His command backed by all power)
- ✅ **A mission** (make disciples by going, baptizing, teaching)
- ✅ **His presence** (He is with you always)

**You have everything you need.**

**The only question is: Will you obey?**

---

**[FINAL CALL TO ACTION]**

This week:

1. **Write down 3 names** and commit to pray for them daily
2. **Take one step** toward making disciples (invite someone to church, share your testimony, study Scripture to grow)
3. **Pray this prayer** when you're afraid: "Jesus, You are with me. Help me obey."

**Don't wait for perfect conditions. Don't wait until you feel ready. Don't wait until it's convenient.**

**Jesus said "Go."**

**And He promised: "I am with you always."**

**Let's pray.**

---

### **CLOSING PRAYER**

_"Lord Jesus, You have all authority in heaven and on earth. We confess that we've often ignored Your command to make disciples because we felt inadequate, afraid, or comfortable._

_But You didn't call us because we're qualified—You called us because You are with us._

_Give us eyes to see the mission field You've placed us in. Give us courage to go, even when it's scary. Give us wisdom to teach others what You've taught us. And help us trust that You are with us, every single day, until You return._

_We surrender our comfortable Christianity. We embrace our mission. We trust in Your presence and power._

_In Jesus' name, Amen."_




### Things to Improve

1. Be confident in what you are sharing
2. Try to play with my voice---don't be monotonous. Put emotions
3. Don't use "churchy" words (jargons)
4. Try to be conversationa. Be more interactive. Look them in the eyes. Let them agree. Make them feel that you are really talking to them, not just reporting something.
5. Try to observe how others lead their devotionals. On how they approach it and their template
