### 09/04/24 - Physical Analogy of the Christian Life

1. God's Word/Bible - fresh food
2. Sunday Service - processed food
3. Prayer - breathing (we should pray in everything we do)
4. Sharing the Gospel - like a proud son sharing how great his father is
5. Fellowship - accountability/checking up on their journey

  
**Not signs of a mature Christian**
1. Age
2. Number of posts
3. Ministries joined
4. All talk

• These are all good things, but it is not the ruler for measurement that we should use to determine a mature Christian

  
**Signs of a mature Christian**
1. You see trials as training 
	- you embrace trials
2. You pray with a wide perspective
	- you dont pray only about yourself
3. You respond to rebuke with receptivity
4. Your habitual sins are fading
	- mature christians still sin, but they repent
	- they always pray that God will make them hate the sin

### 09/18/24 - Biblical Salt and Light Comparison

How do you differentiate being a salt to the world and being a light to the world?

#### **Salt**

- (example) Your classmates are watching pornography in the classroom openly. They hastily stop and hide their devices when they notice you entering the room because they regard you as a 'pastor'. You are keeping them from sinning anymore than they have done.
- you stick to a specific person or group
- biblical correction
- sharing


#### Light

- (example) You decide to commute on the bus today, and you start thanking God openly about how great He is to your life while looking lively and joyful, raising your hands in praise and everything. The people around you become inspired and think to themselves how great it would be to be as open in praising God as you have done.
- you don't have to stick; you become a light just by being near them
- posting


#### My Questions

1. Paano po nadidifferentiate yung biblical correction sa pagiging judgemental?
2. May nanotice po ako na different interpretation sa difference to being a salt and being a light, tapos gusto ko lang po sana malaman if tama parin po ba?
3. Example, may kilala po kayo na part of the lgbtq community,

## 01/17/26 - When God Says Go, Don't Say No

**Main Scripture**: Amos 7:10-16a

What are the things you want to pursue but feel unqualified for?

- We dont lack commitment. We lack confidence
- God often calls us before we feel ready.
- Like in the life of Amos, if God calls you even if you're unqualified, obey, commit, and go. 
- God does not call the qualified---He qualifies the obedient.
