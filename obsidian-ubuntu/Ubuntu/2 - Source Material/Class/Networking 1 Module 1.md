# Networking 1 Module 1


Networking
-  is the process of connecting computers together so that  
they can share information.  
-  is the practice of transporting and exchanging data  
between nodes over a shared medium in an information  
system. 
- Networking comprises not only the design,  
construction and use of a network, but also the management,  
maintenance and operation of the network infrastructure,  
software and policies.  


#### Features
◼ Sharing − networks enable sharing of files and other IT  
resources.  
◼ Speed − client machines are getting faster so that the processing  
time becomes up to par with setups that processes tasks through  
a central server.  
◼ Scalability − network setups are completely scalable to enable  
additional components to be easily deployed.  
◼ Integration − all the components of the network work in synch  
through network operating systems.  
◼ Security − networks can be configured to restrict access to  
authorized users only.  
◼ Cost Effectiveness − Networking reduces the need to purchase  
equipment for each user (printers, scanners, etc) through  
sharing.

Some of networking's main uses are as follows:  
◼ Information and Resource Sharing - computer networks allow organizations to share information.
◼ Retrieving Remote Information  
◼ Speedy Interpersonal Communication  
◼ E-Commerce  
◼ Highly Reliable Systems  
◼ Cost–Effective Systems  
◼ VoIP

Servers
- computers that manage the resources of the network
- examples include: file servers, database servers, etc

Client
- computers that request and receive service from the servers to access and use the network resources

Peers
- computers that give and take services from other computers in a workgroup network

Networking Media

Connecting Devices
- common examples: routers, bridges, hubs, repeaters, gateways, switches, access point, modem, and brouter (combination of router and bridge)

Functions
- helps set up and install compute networks
- allows users to have access to network resources
- allows admin to add or remove users from the network, and also helps protect from unauthorized attacks

Web Browser
- acts on behalf of user to contact a web server to request and receive information to display on the screen

Plug-in
- to view special file types
