Intranet
- within our home
- physically secured computer network system
- covers a small area and only authorized people can access it

Extranet

Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
- technical expression for public telephone systems

### Network Topologies
Network Topology
- refers to the physical or logical layout of a network
- the usual setup
- shows how nodes are interconnected with each other and how the data is transferred between them

#### 2 Types

Physical Topology
- actual layout of the wires or media
- cost, scalability, flexibility, and bandwidth capacity matters

Logical Topology
- focuses on the data transfers
- examples: token ring, fiber

Mesh Topology
- each device is connected to another device through a dedicated point-to-point link
- if one link fails, it does not affect the others
- expensive because of the amount of wires

Full Mesh Topology
- n(n-1)/2

Partially-Connected Mesh Topology
- inexpensive way to reduce redundancy

Star Topology
- each device is connected to a central device called a hub/switch
- there is a difference bet
- no direct communication
- if central device fails, communication will be cut
- dota

Ring Topology
