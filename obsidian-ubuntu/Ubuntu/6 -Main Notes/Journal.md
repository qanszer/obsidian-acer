### October 10/7/25  ---  "Flowers"

I'm writing this to help myself get rid of the accumulated thoughts for the day, so that I can sleep soundly. And also because I want to screen record my saved matches in ML. The latter's probably my main reason...

Mmmmmm thoughts, thoughts. 

I've been wanting to apologize to my father for my lashing out last Sunday, and opportunities were presented---like during the times where he drops me off outside of the subdivision. I know that it's the right thing to do, and that it's probably also the best thing to do. But the problem is, I immediately dismiss it. Thoughts come up like, "He never says sorry to me anyway for all the wrong things he's done", or "It's awkward and no one does this in our family anyway", and many more. 

I forgot that I plan on buying my mother flowers. I need to remember to do that

The first thing I'll do when I wake up is to drink water.

Una kong gagawin paggising is iinom ng tubig.

My goals for tomorrow would be to first finish all my assignments. Second, finish the lyrics in its minimum. Third, do my daily coding. And lastly, continue and improve the lyrics.




### October 10/19/25  ---  "Sign"

It was already Sunday---the last day of your short visit here in Manila---and we still haven't met since your visit here.

The first chance to meet was last Friday, but my negligence in decision-making inevitably cancelled it. I even made you wait and expect for the whole night. Sorry. 

The second opportunity I saw was on dusk of Saturday. By this point, I was frustrated at myself. And desperate for redemption from my short-sighted action. This sounds stupid now, but I planned on meeting with you by 4:30am and make farewells only 30 minutes after. Thank you for adamantly declining me even against my pushy requests to make it happen, love. You're always, and have always been, the best.

The third opportunity came---1pm at MoA on Sunday. It seemed plausible the night before, but when the day actually came, many setbacks happened. First of all, the opening service of the church took way longer than expected because of the spontaneous testimonies. This made me message you for the possible outcome of me arriving at 1:30-2:00pm in MoA. Your reply was like a thorn that pricked my heart. "By that time, basin magkita na mi balik". It sounded like I was the only one who wanted to make this work. And that either you had no intentions of fighting to make us meet, or that you used manipulation to make me impatient and go earlier.



PS. Looking back now, this seemed like a challenge from God for me in regards with my obedience to Him. I passed. I attended Unite for leadership training, even when I was busy and even though I personally didn't want to go for lazy reasons. I also did not do things my own way today; instead; I obeyed Him.
