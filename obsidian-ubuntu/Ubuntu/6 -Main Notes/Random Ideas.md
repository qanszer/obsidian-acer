#### Anonymous Questions Idea
During lecture, some students have questions but they don't ask it when the professor gives them the time to do so because they are either:
- afraid that they will be thought of as stupid by the others for asking a simple question
- do not want to speak loudly
- prefer the question to be anonymous

solution: use/make an app where the students can type out their questions there anonymously, in real time, during the lecture wherein the professor will read and answer it after a segment of their lecture is done.
