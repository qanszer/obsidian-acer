# How to Win Friends and Influence People


***10 RULES TO REMEMBER WHILE READING THIS BOOK:

1. Have a hungry desire to learn how to handle talking with other people
2. Read each chapter rapidly at first, and then read it slowly while taking note of the important insights
3. Ask how and when I can apply a learning
4. Highlight suggestions that I feel I can use
5. My learning will only become a habit if I constantly review and apply it.
6. Apply the rules at every opportunity. Only knowledge that is used will stick to my mind, which then becomes wisdom.
7. Hesitate on doing the natural or impulsive reaction. It is usually the wrong response. Instead, refer back to the rules I've noted in this book.
8. Give 1 peso to the person I'm talking to if I catch myself violating a principle.
9. Every Saturday night, I should devote time to review all my conversations for the past week, and ask myself these questions:
	- a. What mistakes did I do at that time?
	- b. What did I do right? And how can I improve my performance?
	- c. What lessons can I learn from my experience?
10. Make a record of all instances when the application of these principles paid off. Be very specific. Include names, dates, and the results to inspire myself more.




### PRINCIPLE I  -  Do not criticize, condemn, or complain.

> *"Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment."*

It is apparently stupid to criticize others. I believe it is a subconscious thought that arises in everyone's mind for a moment, but for most of us we just discard it---not take it to heart. 

So this can undeniably be considered great wisdom from people older than me, because I would not have to suffer the same consequences they did before, if I apply this principle to my life now.

I am quite guilty of this principle. Because I am quick to judge, criticize, and ridicule others. Especially on my family members and to people online who do not know me personally. As for my acquaintances, I subconsciously act like a saint as much as possible to them, which is dual-faced and bad. I can roughly guess the core reason as to why I have this attitude---my childhood. I am not avoiding accountability for my attitude now. I just want to write out and articulate my side of the story. Although I can see how this can be considered as striving to justify myself like how victims of criticism are, based on its aforementioned definition. 

Both of my parents especially my father, as well as my grandmother, were quick to criticize and sermon me whenever I do something they didn't like. Playing video games first thing in the morning, not completely eating all the chicken meat near the bones, not eating most kinds of vegetables, not washing the dishes, not reading the Bible and praying at night, not doing my assignments first before having fun, for being skinny, for listening to non-Christian music, and many more.

"Daghan mga bata sa gawas nga walay gikaon, walay papa ug mama, unya ikaw diri kay spoiled kaayo. Di mukaon"
"Unsa mnang gipaminaw nimo uy, maot kaayos dunggan. Nganong di man ka maminaw ug Christian music nalang? Mas nindot pa"
"Gaaksaya ra mog oras sigeg duwa, sigeg tanaw sa youtube. Paghimog mga butang sa bay"

These are only a small portion of the countless things they told and criticized me for. They can be considered as small things, but they made a clear impact in my life. Many of their criticisms were for a good reason, others just their personal opinion, and some for no reason at all---just them lashing out their stress on me. But what I realized is this: 
	My childhood experiences above are a personal testament of how criticism can hurt a person's pride, build lifelong resentment, and only strive for themselves to be justified in their actions. 
Because of their criticisms, I still don't listen to Christian music by my own even though I like it, I still don't finish all the meat on my chicken meals, and I still have struggles in reading the Bible daily and praying every night even though I want to do so now as someone who understands the importance of it in my life.

So please, me, unlearn the part of yourself---that overly trained muscle---of criticizing and ridiculing others. You know firsthand what it can do to people.
