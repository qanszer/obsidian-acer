#### Notes from the Book "Why We Sleep"

**CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUOUS LACK OF SLEEP (Less than 6-7 hours)**

- Demolishes your immune system
- More than doubles your risk of cancer
- Much more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease
- Disrupts blood sugar levels to the point that you would be classified as pre-diabetic
- Increases the likelihood of your coronary arteries becoming blocked and brittle, eventually resulting toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure
- Contributes to all major psychiatric conditions like depression, anxiety, and suicidality
- Makes you feel hungry despite being full---a proven recipe for weight gain
- If you attempt to diet while lacking sleep, most of the weight you'll lose will come from lean body mass, not body fat


Drowsy driving is the cause of hundreds of thousands of traffic accidents and fatalities each year. As much as possible, **don't drive while sleep-deprived.**

Vehicular accidents by drowsy driving **exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs** **combined**.


Every major organ and brain process within our bodies are enhanced optimally by sleep, but also detrimentally impaired when we lack sleep.


**SLEEP'S BENEFITS**

1. **Within the Brain**
	- improves our ability to learn and memorize
	- improves our making of logical decisions and choices
	- services our psychological health
	- recalibrates our emotional brain circuits
	- allows us to navigate next-day social and psychological challenges with cool-headed composure
2. **Within the Immune System**
	- fights malignancy
	- prevents infection
	- wards off all manner of sickness
3. **Within the Digestive/Endocrine System**
	- fine-tunes the balance of insulin and circulating glucose
	- maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut from which much of our nutritional health begins
	- lowers blood pressure
	- keeps our hearts in fine condition


**Health Trinity - Balanced diet, exercise, and sleep**
Sleep is the top priority between them 3


**SO HOW SHOULD WE SLEEP?**

1. **Sleep for 7-8 hours** at night (6 hours at the very least)
	- Best time to sleep is 9pm-11pm
2. **Nap for 30-60 minutes** in the afternoon
	- Post-prandial alertness dip (prandium=meal) is a descent from high-degree wakefulness to low-level alertness. It is a normal part of the daily rhythm of life that society now neglects
	- Napping in the afternoon decreases your risk of death from heart disease  by a whopping 37%, and over 60% for workingmen(?)
	- In the small enclaves of Greece where siestas(afternoon naps) still remain intact in their culture, men are nearly 4 times as likely to reach the age of 90 as American men
