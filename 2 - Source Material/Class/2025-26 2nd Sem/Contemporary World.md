There is no world government to coordinate and facilitate cooperation among all actors to deal with threats and challenges. 

Therefore, global governance is needed.

#### Global Governance

- “…sum of the many ways individuals and institutions, public and private, manage their common affairs…” (Commission on Global Governance)
- “… collection of governance-related activities, rules and mechanisms, formal and informal, existing at a variety of levels in the world today, also referred to as the ‘pieces of global governance’…” (Karns and Mingst)

		2. conventions
		3. customary practices
		4. writings of legal scholars

	- **3666 treaties** were concluded during 1951-1995
	- Example: UN (United Nations)
2. **International Norms or Soft Law**
	- standard of behaviors such as:
		a. some human rights
		b. labor rights
		c. framework conventions on climate change and biodiversity
3. **International Government Organizations (IGOs)**

6. **Global Conference**
