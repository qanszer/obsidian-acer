# Why We Sleep


### One-Sentence Summary

This book is a wake-up call to society about the importance of sleep and on how to improve sleep quality.


### My Top 5 Key Actions

1. **Same sleep schedule every day, even weekends (most important)**
2. **No screens 1 hour before bed**
3. **Cool, dark bedroom**
4. **Morning sunlight within 30 minutes of waking up**
5. **Take a 20-30 minute nap only between 1-3pm**


### Other Learnings to Keep in Mind

- No caffeine after 2pm (coffee, black/green tea)
- Eat dinner 2-3 hours before bed
- Avoid alcohol before bed. It helps you sleep but it is not natural and therefore detrimental. It also blocks REM sleep
- Avoid medications that delay/disrupt sleep
- No naps after 3pm
- Exercise improves sleep quality
- No stress before bed (like intense conversations)
- Take a hot bath 90 minutes before sleep if you can
- Bedroom should be 18-19C cold, and pitch-black (blackout curtains or eye mask)
- If you can't sleep after 20 minutes of lying in bed, get up. The bed should only be associated with sleep and sex
- No to sleeping pills. It is asssociated with higher mortality risk and memory problems
- A sign that you're getting enough sleep is you feel alert during the day

- Don't try to "catch up" on sleep on weekends (disrupts rhythm)
- Don't pull all-nighters (even once has severe consequences)
- Don't create anxiety trying to force yourself to have 7-8 hours of sleep

## 01 - To Sleep


#### Notes

**CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUOUS LACK OF SLEEP (Less than 6-7 hours)**

- Demolishes your immune system
- More than doubles your risk of cancer
- Much more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease
- Disrupts blood sugar levels to the point that you would be classified as pre-diabetic
- Increases the likelihood of your coronary arteries becoming blocked and brittle, eventually resulting toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure
- Contributes to all major psychiatric conditions like depression, anxiety, and suicidality
- Makes you feel hungry despite being full---a proven recipe for weight gain
- If you attempt to diet while lacking sleep, most of the weight you'll lose will come from lean body mass, not body fat


Drowsy driving is the cause of hundreds of thousands of traffic accidents and fatalities each year. As much as possible, **don't drive while sleep-deprived.**

Vehicular accidents by drowsy driving **exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs** **combined**.


Every major organ and brain process within our bodies are enhanced optimally by sleep, but also detrimentally impaired when we lack sleep.


**SLEEP'S BENEFITS**

1. **Within the Brain**
	- improves our ability to learn and memorize
	- improves our making of logical decisions and choices
	- services our psychological health
	- recalibrates our emotional brain circuits
	- allows us to navigate next-day social and psychological challenges with cool-headed composure
2. **Within the Immune System**
	- fights malignancy
	- prevents infection
	- wards off all manner of sickness
3. **Within the Digestive/Endocrine System**
	- fine-tunes the balance of insulin and circulating glucose
	- maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut from which much of our nutritional health begins
	- lowers blood pressure
	- keeps our hearts in fine condition


**Health Trinity - Balanced diet, exercise, and sleep**
Sleep is the top priority between them 3


**SO HOW SHOULD WE SLEEP?**

1. **Sleep for 7-8 hours** at night (6 hours at the very least)
	- Best time to sleep is 9pm-11pm
2. **Nap for 30-60 minutes** in the afternoon
	- Post-prandial alertness dip (prandium=meal) is a descent from high-degree wakefulness to low-level alertness. It is a normal part of the daily rhythm of life that society now neglects
	- Napping in the afternoon decreases your risk of death from heart disease  by a whopping 37%, and over 60% for workingmen(?)
	- In the small enclaves of Greece where siestas(afternoon naps) still remain intact in their culture, men are nearly 4 times as likely to reach the age of 90 as American men

I decided to drop this book after chapter 1 because of the loss of interest in reading the rest of it after knowing about its statistical issues etc. 

Most of the book's info (~80%) still stand, so what I did is that I asked Claude AI to summarize all the call-to-action infos from this book.
