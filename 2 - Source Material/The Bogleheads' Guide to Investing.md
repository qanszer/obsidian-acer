## 00 - Foreword


#### Main Idea

The Bogleheads movement was a naturally created group of people who were inspired by John C. "Jack" Bogle's way of life---particularly in his financial and moral lifestyle. The 2 core principles of a Boglehead is that investing should be simple, and that fellow Bogleheads should be eager to help one another in investing.


#### Key Takeaways

-  **01:** Simplicity is the core of successful investing for the Bogleheads.
-  **02:** To become a successful investor, I need to have the courage and discipline to stay to the course that I have set after careful planning. That no matter what happens to the market, I stick with my plan.
-  **03:** The authors recognize that beating the market is essentially an impossible feat. It is a losing game.


#### Actions

What will I actually DO with this? (specific, concrete actions)

-  This is not specific and concrete, but I want to love learning. Because learning is to the studious, and riches to the careful.

> 
>  *"In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as_ pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it perhaps often in my history; for even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility."*

## 00 - Introduction


#### Main Idea

It reiterates the purpose of this book, as well as a section dedicated to the person who spurred the 3 authors to write this book---John C. "Jack" Bogle. It also gives here the overview of what the readers will learn.


#### Key Takeaways

-  **01:** "Do not value money for any more nor any less than its worth; it is a good servant but a bad master."
-  **02:** This book was written assuming that the reader has no financial knowledge.
-  **03:** This book is not a high-powered, get-rich-quick weekend seminar or any of its kind---it has no agenda other than to teach others their long-tested and timeless investment strategy.


#### Actions

What will I actually DO with this? (specific, concrete actions)

-  Currently can't think of any actionable learning here aside from mindset shifts.
