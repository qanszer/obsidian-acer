## 01 - Bury Your Boomerangs

#### Main Idea

Do not criticize, condemn, or complain

#### Key Takeaways

-  **01:** Never criticize/condemn/complain no matter how right you are or how wrong they are
-  **02:** Calm yourself before replying back when you are put off. The first five minutes are usually the most volatile. Save yourself from the future trouble by taking a step back before spouting something you might come to regret
-  **03:** The people most widely respected within industries, companies, families, and groups of friends are those who are clear in their own viewpoints while remaining compassionate with those whose minds or behavior they would like to influence


#### Actions

- Don't be quick to judge/condemn others when they are wrong
- Never criticize/condemn/complain no matter how right you are or how wrong they are
- Never criticize/condemn/complain whether in public or private conversations
- Calm yourself before replying back when you are put off. The first five minutes are usually the most volatile. Save yourself from the future trouble by taking a step back before spouting something you might come to regret


#### Learnings

- One's reputation can be destroyed the fastest it's ever been because of modern technology
- The unfortunate reality is that today's culture is of criticism and complaint
- It is our natural instinct as self-preserving humans to defend, deflect, and deny all threats to our well-being, including threats to our pride
- No one enjoys being the subject of disapproval, whether or not it is deserved
- Using criticism to win an argument or prove a point takes us two steps backward
- We now live in an age where our communication catastrophes can follow us forever in our life. That's why it would do ourselves well to follow that simple principle---don't criticize, condemn, or complain
